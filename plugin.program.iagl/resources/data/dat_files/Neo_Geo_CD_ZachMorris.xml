		<emu_comment>Neo Geo CD is the second home video game console of SNK's Neo Geo family, released in 1994, four years after its cartridge-based equivalent. This is the same platform, converted to the cheaper CD format.  The unit's 1X CD-ROM drive is slow, with very long loading times of up to 56 Mbit of data per load. The system can also play Audio CDs. All three versions of the system have no region-lock.[CR]The Neo Geo CD was launched bundled with a control pad instead of a joystick like the AES version. However, the original AES joystick can be used with all three Neo Geo CD models.[CR]Developer:  SNK[CR]Manufacturer:  SNK[CR]CPU:  Motorola 68000[CR]Memory:  64KB RAM, 74KB VRAM[CR]Sound:  Yamaha YM2610[CR]Display:  320x224[CR]Media:  CD[CR]Max.

		<plot>In the year 2020, baseball finally evolved. There is no longer conventional professional baseball in 2020. Baseball designed by the Super Baseball Association has been very popular and is the best sport.[CR]However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball. Finally, a fair game is going to be played at Cyber Egg Stadium.</plot>

		<plot>3 Count Bout is a one-on-one fighting game. Choose from ten wrestlers who have their own power attacks. There are ten rounds in the game, and each one of them has you fighting other wrestlers that are much tougher than the previous ones. You defeat each one by biting, kicking, and performing other moves to the point where their damage meter is empty. But just because it is empty doesn't mean that you win. You have to pin him for the infamous-three count. Also features competitive play and tag match battles.</plot>

		<plot>The general premise in the series is that a scientist, Dr. Brown, having perfected a time machine, organized a tournament for various fighters throughout all of history to combat each other to see who is the world's mightiest fighter. True to this plot, many of the fighters are based on actual historical figures.[CR]This game also marked the debut of Jack and Ryofu, which many players considered to be unfairly powerful.</plot>

		<plot>Alpha Mission II is a top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter and the sequel to Alpha Mission. When the game starts the player picks two armors for their SYD, and additional armors can be purchased at the end of each level. Armors add additional firepower to the ship while equipped, and will be destroyed when shot, saving the ship from one hit. The SYD's primary weapons, a straight ahead laser and falling bombs, can be upgraded from icons dropped by specific enemies. Similarly to Xevious ground targets can only be hit by bombs, while aerial targets can only be hit by lasers.</plot>

		<plot>Aggressors of Dark Kombat is another one-on-one street fighting beat 'em up from the Neo-Geo's seemingly endless library of fighters.[CR]It pits 8 fighters of different styles and strengths against each other in a tournament to see who's the toughest mofo on the streets of Tokyo. Your objective as usual is to deplete your opponent's health bar within the time limit by using your basic attacks and special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) while avoiding his moves and attacks.[CR]Unique to Aggressors of Dark Kombat is the combination of traditional side-scrolling beat 'em up elements, meaning characters can freely move in an isometric space instead of being restricted to a single plane of movement. Weapons and throw-able items are usually thrown into the arena by the crowds and you can pick them up and wield them for added damage. Additionally, matches are 1-round only affairs, with an extended multi-layered health bar that allows for longer rounds than usual.</plot>

		<plot>Somewhere in Hong Kong, two martial artists face each other in a vast courtyard. The challenger is a stout man in brown skin. The ground has been tainted with blood. However, his crescent blade hasn't touched his opponent yet. It was a one-sided battle. He was already exhausted and it won't be long before hewould fall. &quot;Fool, you will become one of my family&quot; resounded the opponent's voice, as the challenger crumbled to the floor and was turned into sand.[CR]The Fighting Instinct Tournament, or FIST, is a tournament as fierce as its name suggest. There was no shortage of martial artists who entered the tournament seeking fame, and yet there were many who left the tournament as corpses. The last challenger who remains in this lawless tournament gets to challenge the organizer of the tournament, the Head of the Huang Financial Clique, for the chance to win the massive prize money. The martial artist who can manage to defeat him will obtain the honor of truly calling him or herself the strongest. However, none of the martial artists who were chosen to challenge the champion in a private final match have ever come back alive. Nobody knows when exactly the tournament is held, since only an avaricious will was spiraling over there. The sponsor is actually an evil spirit who possessed the body of a modern man from Hong Kong who has established a selection system to amplify his dark powers. The FIST tournament has gathered numerous participants from around the globe and another sacrifice will be chosen this year.</plot>

		<plot>In the enchanted land of Belkana all was well until plagues of creatures started rampaging through. But it didn't stop there, from deep within the mountains of Graisia, the Demon Warlord Nausizz arose and led the attacks wiping out settlement after settlement. However a brave warrior called &quot;The Knight of the Journey&quot; came a long way on a quest to stop these monstrosities. After aiding the Poor Village of Dio from the Caterdragon, the knight heads to the Castle Pulista, but as he is briefed by the king of the problems they face, an elite dark knight appears and kidnaps the princess. The knight fights his way through the enemy lands in the Matius Tower, the Gauda Fortress, the Land Battleship and finally passes the Entrance to the Devil World. Along his way, he is helped by loyalties of the kingdom. The knight battles through the Castle Graisia and comes face to face with Nausizz. As a demon with honour, Nausizz is so impressed with the knight's progress, that he has sent the princess back to Pulista. As the knight defeats Nausizz, he transforms into a fiendish demon dragon. The knight slays him and escapes the collapsing castle. Back in Castle Pulista the knight is offered to come and live with the king. Peace can proceed once more in Belkana.</plot>

		<plot>Cyber-Lip is a horizontally scrolling, side-view platformer shoot 'em up (this combination is sometimes referred to as &quot;run and gun&quot;) arcade game released by SNK in 1990 for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS. The player(s) control(s) Rick and/or Brook, two human veteran soldiers, who are sent by an unspecified &quot;federal government&quot; into combat on a last-ditch attempt to save Earth from a malfunctioning military supercomputer in charge of all military androids. Gameplay consists of battling through large amounts of enemies, collecting power-ups and defeating several end-of-stage bosses. This makes it comparable to the likes of Metal Slug or Contra in terms of gameplay.[CR]It is noted that a handful of members from Irem developed this title and later went on to create Metal Slug.[CR]The game was later ported over for the Neo Geo CD system, in 1995. The CD featured improved voice acting and added a short introduction to the game explaining the plot.</plot>

		<plot>The game plays like a conventional fighting game of its time, that is battles are one-on-one and conducted on best two-out-of-three matches. One of the unique aspects of Double Dragon is the lack of specific punch and kick buttons like most fighting games. Instead, there are four attack buttons of varying strength and speed, which can perform punches or kicks depending on the character's position. The player's character and his opponent have a super move meter called the &quot;charge meter&quot;, which is overlaid on the character's remaining health. The less health the character has, the quicker it will fill up. &quot;Charge moves&quot; are usually performed by executing the command of a regular special move and pressing two attack buttons simultaneously at the end instead of just one.[CR]The characters and stages are inspired by the Double Dragon movie featured prominently in the game's intro. This includes the appearances of a submerged Hollywood, the Dragon Mobile vehicle, Billy and Jimmy's ability to transform themselves and the inclusion of Koga Shuko as the game's final boss. However, the game's characters are depicted in a more anime-like style and only six of the game's twelve fighters are actually featured in the movie; Burnov and Duke are from previous Double Dragon games and rest were created specifically for this game. This game is dedicated to Kaneto Shiozawa, who died in 2000 and Daisuke Gri, who died in 2010.</plot>

		<plot>It has been two years since the second King Of Fighters tournament took place. Now Terry, Andy, Joe, Mai and Geese are back in South Town to battle five new characters and three bosses. All of them have their own reasons of coming to South Town, but in the end, everything links to a scroll that reveals the secret to the lost ancient martial arts.[CR]Fatal Fury 3 was a pretty big improvement over its predecessors, introducing brand new re-drawn character sprites (yet again) and better overall animation quality. Of course, a handful of colorful new characters join the roster, in addition to some new 2D environments.[CR]The two-plane gameplay was upgraded to a three plane format known as the Oversway System. Players fight primarily in the middle plane or the main plane, but can move or &quot;oversway&quot; into either of the sway lines at the background or foreground . Attacks between planes have returned but are now called &quot;Oversway Attacks&quot; and players can use special technique to defend these attacks. Other new gameplay elements introduced include air blocking, combination arts, new special &amp; super moves, and even alternate (more powerful) super moves which can only be used once per round.[CR]Along with a cool looking world map, Fatal Fury 3 also features a ranking system when fighting against the computer, which brought some innovation to the fighting genre. When the player wins a round, they'll be ranked from D to triple S. The final opponents the player faces at the end of the single player mode is determined the by the player's average... with a lower score, the game will end against Yamazaki, but with a higher score they will square off against one of the Jin twins, or possibly both. Overall,  Fatal Fury 3  was easily the best presentation of the series to date.</plot>

		<plot>Football Frenzy takes the modern game of football, and tosses out all aspects of the game which don't deal directly with running the ball, throwing the ball, or hitting the guy with the ball. There are no real world teams to contend with, and no real world stats that matter aside from the game's score and the game's time. There are also no substitutions.[CR]Football Frenzy uses the Neo Geo's sprite scaling capabilities to provide either panned out or close in views depending on the action going on. The game is played from a top down perspective, but tilted to an angle so player profiles are more easily visible. Only a small portion of the field is visible at any time; to aid in orientation the game provides both a wireframe field with the current viewable portion indicated on the bottom of the screen, and a bar with sliding coloring indicating the current ball position on the field.</plot>

		<plot>The gameplay is straightforward with elements similar to that of Capcom's 19XX games, but it is incredibly difficult even on the easiest difficulty level. Unlike most scrolling shooters, the vehicle is a seaplane instead of spaceship or airplane. As the in-game instructions indicate, move the joystick around to maneuver the seaplane. Press the A Button to fire bullets. The player can also hold the A button for a semi-automatic fire. Press the B Button to launch bombs from the inventory. The player starts with 3 bombs.</plot>

		<plot>Kabuki Klash is a 2D fighting game that features characters from the Japanese role-playing series Tengai Maky, also known as Far East of Eden. The heroes of the three first Tengai Maky games must participate in a tournament and find out who is the most skillful fighter in the magical land of Jipang (which is very similar to the medieval Japan). The characters include well-known Far East of Eden heroes such as Ziria, Manjimaru, Kabuki, Orochimaru, and others - a total of eight playable characters. During the fights, you can either punch, kick, or use special attacks, that require a precise usage of buttons and also deplete your magic gauge. There are random items (such as healing potions) thrown on the battle field while you are fighting, which you can pick up.</plot>

		<plot>Fighter's History was probably the most blatant rip-off of Street Fighter 2 in history (hence the title). Lo and behold, Data East had the audacity to make a sequel a year after the release of the original, even after Capcom tried to sue them for ripping off SF2.[CR]Fighter's History Dynamite (also known as Karnov's Revenge) is at least an improvement over the original. The sequel adds playable bosses (Clown and Karnov) and two new characters: Zazie &amp; Yungmie. Besides a better selection of playable characters and some new backgrounds, the game itself really hasn't changed very much in terms of looks or gameplay.[CR]While playing Karnov's Revenge, there's just no way to shake the feeling that this game is trying to be Street Fighter 2 with a different cast of characters. For the second time around, it doesn't offer any true innovation to the fighting game genre. Although, you could unlock a special fight against a bull if you beat the game without losing a single round, but who the hell would want to play this game for that long?</plot>

		<plot>Rugal Bernstein is an incredibly rich and notorious arms and drug trafficker, as well as an incredibly skilled and ruthless fighter. Having become bored with the lack of competition, Rugal decides to host a new King of Fighters tournament. Rugal has his secretary travel to eight destinations around the world and invite fighters to his new tournament. Unlike the previous KOF tournaments depicted in the Fatal Fury series, the new King of Fighters is a team tournament, with eight teams of three, each representing a different nationality, participating this time. Most characters come from other SNK games, such as Team Italy, which is composed of three heroes from the original Fatal Fury: Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi. The two heroes from Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia) are featured along with their mentor and Ryo's father (Takuma Sakazaki) make up Team Mexico. Team Korea features Kim Kaphwan from Fatal Fury 2 as the leader of two convicts he's trying to reform Chang Koehan and Choi Bounge, while Team England is a mix of female fighters from Fatal Fury 2 (Mai Shiranui) and the Art of Fighting series (Yuri Sakazaki, King). The two heroes from Psycho Soldier (Athena Asamiya and Sie Kensou) form Team China along with their mentor, Chin Gentsai. Similarly, Team Brazil features the heroes from Ikari Warriors (Ralf and Clark) along with their commanding officer Heidern. Additionally, the game features two teams composed entirely of original characters: Team Japan featuring Kyo Kusanagi, Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon, and Team USA composed of Heavy D!, Lucky Glauber and Brian Battler.</plot>

		<plot>The King of Fighters '95 marks the beginning of a story arc that later became known as the &quot;Orochi Saga&quot;. However, the only elements from the Orochi Saga known in this game is the introduction of Kyo's rival, Iori Yagami, and Rugal's use of the Orochi power[CR]Rugal Bernstein, thought to have perished in an explosion in the previous game, had in fact survived and sent out invitations to the teams from the previous game signed simply 'R'. Only one of the previous teams failed to attend the new tournament: the American Sports Team, now replaced by the &quot;Rival Team&quot; consisting of Iori Yagami, Billy Kane (from Fatal Fury: King of Fighters), and Eiji Kisaragi (from Art of Fighting 2). Saisyu Kusanagi, Kyo's father, appears as a fighter for the first time (having made a non-playable cameo in KOF '94) as a computer-controlled sub-boss character. After defeating Saisyu in the arcade mode, it is revealed that Saisyu was being brainwashed and that Rugal will fight once again as a boss character, but as an enhanced version named &quot;Omega Rugal&quot;.</plot>

		<plot>A new King of Fighters tournament was announced, though the letters of invitation sent out to the fighters were no longer sent by Rugal Bernstein. The letters also announced many changes, the first of which being a massive overhaul of the tournament's approach. During the time that had passed between the tournaments since the previous year, the King of Fighters tournament's fame had grown immensely, to the point that it turned into a major international event, which had not happened before. Huge corporations transformed the King of Fighters tournament into something widely televised, commercialized, and celebrated, drawing in many crowds from around the world. The tournament is now held by Chizuru Kagura: a descendant of the ancient Yata Clan responsible for sealing the Orochi demon along with the Kusanagi and Yasanaki clan (the clans from Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, respectively). Chizuru uses the tournament in hopes of finding and recruiting Kyo and Iori in order to stop the upcoming Orochi threat, but Kyo and Iori aren't exactly willing to work together on friendly terms.</plot>

		<plot>A new King of Fighters tournament was announced, though the letters of invitation sent out to the fighters were no longer sent by Rugal Bernstein. The letters also announced many changes, the first of which being a massive overhaul of the tournament's approach. During the time that had passed between the tournaments since the previous year, the King of Fighters tournament's fame had grown immensely, to the point that it turned into a major international event, which had not happened before. Huge corporations transformed the King of Fighters tournament into something widely televised, commercialized, and celebrated, drawing in many crowds from around the world. The tournament is now held by Chizuru Kagura: a descendant of the ancient Yata Clan responsible for sealing the Orochi demon along with the Kusanagi and Yasanaki clan (the clans from Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, respectively). Chizuru uses the tournament in hopes of finding and recruiting Kyo and Iori in order to stop the upcoming Orochi threat, but Kyo and Iori aren't exactly willing to work together on friendly terms.</plot>

Unlike in previous games of the series, there are four characters per team instead of three. In total, there are seven teams, each containing four characters, four Team Edit characters and a boss.</plot>

		<plot>King of the Monsters 2 is a 2D wrestling/fighting game with three monsters for players to select. Once the monster selection is completed players must guide their monsters through a series of stages consisting of parts of various famous world cities. Each level consists of a short side-scrolling portion in which the player's monster must deal with things like attacking tanks and ships. At the end of the side scrolling portion the alien boss monster appears for a fight.[CR]The buildings and vehicles in the stages sometimes give up certain items when destroyed. The best type to collect is the power-up icon; up to two of these can be collected to boost the monster's strength. There are also icons that make monsters move faster or slower, drain collected power-up levels, explode for damage, or just provide points. Accumulated power-up levels carry over into subsequent stages.</plot>

		<plot>Magician Lord puts you in charge of Elta, a wizard who has the task of collecting eight books of wisdom from the clutches of Az Atorse, the god of destruction. By collecting the right power-ups along the way, you can transform into different characters, including the Rajin, Samurai, Waterman, Shinobi, Poseidon, and Dragon Warrior. Each character has different abilities. There are eight areas in the game, and each stage ends with you trying to defeat both a guardian and the end-of-area boss (which are basically Atorse's incarnations). One of the first games that demonstrated the graphical abilities of the Neo-Geo.</plot>

		<plot>In 2028, General Donald Morden launches an all-out, global attack against the Regular Army. With superior numbers and equipment, the Rebellion overwhelms the unsuspecting Regular Army troops easily.[CR]The attacks could have been countered effectively, or even prevented, should the high-ranking officials have listened to the Regular Army's intelligence community, which had been warning about all sorts of indications that the Rebellion could attack at any moment in decisive force. Unfortunately, the same officials decide to save their own skins and announce that it was the intelligence failure that led to such catastrophe, which the personnel serving in the intelligence community did not appreciate whatsoever.[CR]Meanwhile, Regular Army is pushed to near annihilation, with cities that it was suppose to be protecting in ruins. General Morden makes an announcement that all of the major cities around the world will be under his control within 170 hours, also adding that any resistance would be futile.[CR]The announcement certainly did not discourage a band of Regular Army soldiers attempt to salvage whatever they had left. Shortly after, a group named &quot;Resistants&quot; are formed by surviving members of the Regular Army and its researchers, who began to covertly convert the Metal Slug tank prototypes into combat-ready status in a hidden factory, hoping to launch a counter-offensive to regain what they had lost to the Rebellion. Morden just as quickly learns of this fact and attacks the plant, crushing the Resistants and capturing the tanks, putting an end to the counterattack even before it could begin. The vehicles are then scattered to prevent any ragtag Regular Army troops reclaiming them and using them to launch attacks.[CR]Seeing the Regular Army panic and crumble, 1st Lieutenant Marco Rossi of the Regular Army Peregrine Falcons special forces unit quickly unites remaining Regular Army units and begins a commando operation to reclaim the tanks. Fighting alongside him is Second Lieutenant Tarma Roving from the same unit. Their main objectives were to engage the Rebellion and neutralize its leader, General Morden, while reclaiming the Metal Slug tanks to aid them in battles. If the tanks could not be recaptured, then they would have to destroy them to prevent them from being used by the Rebellion.[CR]The player has to constantly shoot at a continual stream of enemies in order to reach the end of a level. At the end of each level, the player might confront a boss who is often considerably larger than regular enemies and takes many shots to defeat. On the way through the level, the player finds weapons upgrades and &quot;Metal Slug&quot; tanks that can be used not only as weapons but also as added defense.[CR]The protagonists can perform melee attacks by using a knife and/or kicking. The player does not die for simply coming into contact with most enemies. Correspondingly, many of the enemy troops have melee attacks. Much of the game's scenery is destructible. Sometimes this reveals extra items or powerups, most of the time it simply results in collateral damage.[CR]During the course of a level, the player encounters prisoners of war. If they are freed, the player can receive bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. The player receives a score bonus for freeing POWs at the end of the level; at this point the game shows the name and rank for each of the prisoners freed. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs is restarted.[CR]There are a total of six levels, with themes ranging from forests, garrisoned cities, snowy mountain valleys, canyons, and military bases.</plot>

		<plot>General Morden, the antagonist from the first game is back once more with his army, bent on taking over the world. It is up to the Peregrine Falcon squad, who are now joined by two new characters: Eri Kasamoto and Fiolina Germi of the Sparrows Intelligence Unit, to save the day.[CR]As the levels unfold, it turns out that Morden has allied with Martians to help facilitate his plans. In the final level of the game, the tables are turned when Morden comes under attack and is betrayed by his Martian allies and taken prisoner by them. An ad-hoc alliance is formed between the Peregrine Falcon squad and General Morden's army to combat the greater alien threat. After a long battle, they succeed in defeating the Martians' Mothership, driving them off the Earth. Morden seems to have fallen from the ship, strapped to a solid iron plate. While his soldiers celebrate, the plate loses its balance and crushes him.</plot>

		<plot>Another one-on-one fighting game straight from the arcades for the Neo Geo. Ninja Master's (sic.) is set on feudal Japan, and tells the story of 10 unique ninjas who fight each other for their own personal reasons and the chance to defeat the evil Nobunaga and bring peace back to Japan.[CR]As expected for the genre, the game pits your selected character against a series of opponents in best-of-3 round matches, with your objective being to deplete your opponents health bar with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific control motions) and super moves (which rely on a power gauge). All the characters in Ninja Master's fight with their weapon of choice, but you can freely choose to put your weapon away and go mano a mano. This does not have a major impact on speed or attack power, but changes the movesets significantly changing the way even basic attacks work.[CR]Uses 2D sprite-based graphics and features 1P or 2P Vs gameplay.</plot>

		<plot>Power Spikes II is a 2D side-view volleyball game that presents players with three different leagues. Players can compete in either the men's league or women's league using standard volleyball rules, or in a cyber league using cybernetically enhanced players. The rules are the same for all three leagues.[CR]One team starts the game by serving the ball to the other team. As in the real sport of volleyball, the object is to hit the ball across the center net as the other team tries to do the same. If a team fails to hit the ball before it hits the ground, the team that served the ball earns a point, or earns the serve if it was on the receiving end.</plot>

		<plot>Samurai Shodown has been a long-respected 2D fighting series for its animated and colorful characters offset by subtly gritty and intense swordplay. In terms of weapons-based fighters, theres no comparing this game with the brilliant 3D visuals and the fluid offensive-and-defensive gameplay of last years Soul Caliber III, they are of different decades. The original Samurai Shodown came to market the same year as the first Mortal Kombat, and though it offered no finishing moves, the screen was frequently painted red with the arterial spray of blood from the losing character.[CR]In this fifth iteration of Samurai Shodown, however, some of that intensity, and blood, isnt as prevalent. There are a total of 26 characters to choose from, and the series best are represented --  Haohmaru, Hanzo, Jubei, Genjuro, Nakaruru (and her bird). Of course, it wouldnt be an SNK title if there werent some truly bizarre characters as well. Kusaregedo, an oversized mutant with a purple vomit attack, would be a more appropriate character for Ghost Hunter. And true-to-form, the story mode ultimately pits you against Gaoh an overlord who has (wait for it) demon-transformation powers.</plot>

		<plot>The evil King Lion has crowned himself as the master of Fuun-Ken, a new style of martial arts that includes throwing weapons in addition to hand-to-hand combat. This does not sit well with the rest of the Fuun-Ken fighters around the world, so they all decide to beat each other up in classic 2 round fights to decide who gets to get down with King Lion himself.[CR]Savage Reign is a one-on-one 2D fighter in which you select your character and try to defeat all challengers using your basic attacks and special moves. The game features 2 different horizontal planes to which the characters can freely jump to in order to avoid attacks a la Fatal Fury. You cannot escape completely however, as all characters have a throwing weapon they can use in different ways to reach each other no matter where they are.</plot>

		<plot>Stakes Winner is a 2D horse racing game. Taking the role of horse jockeys, players must win a series of races using one of the game's eight selectable horses. Each horse is rated in strength, speed, and stamina, making each horse different in handling. During the game, horse ratings can be boosted through completing bonus levels. Each horse has a stamina bar displayed at the bottom of the screen, next to a picture of the horse's head showing its current health. The stamina bar decreases as the horse runs, and when it is depleted, the race is over for that horse.</plot>

Armed with your fists, a knife and a pistol, you will have to defeat all enemy soldiers you encounter and rescue any trapped scientists.[CR]The Super Spy is played from a first-person perspective. The actual graphics are done using two-dimensional backgrounds and sprites, but are arranged in such a way so that you view the world from your character's eyes. You can scroll left and right through hallways and enter any doors you come across by pressing forward. You can also walk forward into any vertical hallways you encounter to get to horizontal hallways further in the background.

		<plot>Thrash Rally is a fast-paced racing game, similar to Neo Drift Out and Overtop, but using a top-down view. You can either participate in a World Championship or do a complete Paris Dakar rally.[CR]Using basic controls: accelerate with automatic transmission, brake and a combination of both to power drift, you have to follow a set path of courses. In the World Championship, each location consists of different stages that need to be finished in a single run. There is a strict time limit and you receive a time bonus upon finishing a section. The Dakar mode is one long track without stops. The championship uses regular cars, but in the Dakar race you can also choose a sand buggy, off-road bike or a truck.</plot>

		<plot>The game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area, a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special &quot;boss&quot; characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.</plot>

		<plot>The 2D fighter World Heroes 2 Jet is the sequel to 1993's World Heroes 2 and has a total of 16 playable characters, two more than World Heroes 2. The game offers two modes to choose from: a regular mode and a &quot;Forging of the Warrior&quot; mode. The regular mode is like the single-player mode of other fighting games, except that players don't square off against one character.[CR]Instead, players will face off against groups of three characters at a time. Players will fight each character for one round, with the requirement for advancing being to win two of the three rounds. After fighting five sets of three characters, players then face a series of characters in single combat until the ending fight with Zeus.</plot>
