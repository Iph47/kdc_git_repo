		<emu_comment>The PC Engine CD-ROM add-on was released in Japan for the PC Engine console in December of 1988. The North American version, known as the TurboGrafx-CD, went on sale in 1989 for the TurboGrafx-16 (the North American version of the PC Engine). While it had little success in North America, the device boosted sales for the PC Engine in Japan. It helped the PC Engine outsell the NES for a while (up until the release of the SNES) and become the second best-selling console of the 16-bit era, behind the Super Famicom (which later planned its own PlayStation CD add-on) and ahead of the Sega Mega Drive (which later had its own CD-ROM add-on, the Sega CD).[CR]Developer:  Hudson Soft[CR]Manufacturer:  NEC[CR]CPU:  Hudson Soft HuC6280[CR]Memory:  64 kB[CR]Graphics:  HuC6260[CR]Sound:  6 Mini-Wavetable stereo audio channels[CR]Display:  565x242[CR]Media:  CD[CR]Max Controllers:  5 (Via Turbotap)</emu_comment>

		<plot>1552 Tenka Tairan is a war strategy game set during the  Sengoku period of the Japanese history. The three campaign scenarios are set, respectively, in the years 1552, 1582, and 1600. The player is put in the midst of the so-called gekokujou situation, when ambitious daimyo (feudal lords) began to overthrow their superiors, resulting in a global war for dominance in Japan. The player controls such a warlord, choosing one of the available historical figures, or creating his/her own character. Character creation is  Ultima-style; the player is asked a series of questions, and depending on the answer, the player-controlled general will have different statistics.[CR]The gameplay involves managing the army, advancing the troops, conquering neighboring provinces, defending own castle, etc. Though the game pauses when the player makes a decision, the time advances regardless of the player's actions, effectively making Tenka Tairan a real-time strategy game. Battles take place on separate screens, with a wealth of tactical possibilities for positioning and manoeuvring the troops.</plot>

		<title_clean>AV Tanjou</title_clean>
		<plot>AV Tanj&#333; is a simulation game of the type frequently encountered in Japanese games: the so-called "life sim", similar to series such as  Princess Maker or  Graduation. This game is particularly reminiscent of  Tanj&#333;: Debut: the player also manages the lives of three young girls, whose goal is eventually to become what the Japanese call "idol", i.e. a pop star.Compared to Tanj&#333;: Debut, AV Tanj&#333; has simpler gameplay. The player creates schedules for the girls, composed of various activities: studying, aerobics, date, rest, work as a hostess, etc. These activities influence the girls' statistics, and also change their moods. For example, working too much without resting might make a girl sick. Eventually, the girls will turn into what the player wants them to be - full-time hostesses, singers, etc.; but the "true" goal of the game is to unlock all the pictures of the girls in a variety of sexy poses. Some of these pictures feature nudity, which effectively makes AV Tanj&#333; an adult game.</plot>

		<title_clean>Advanced V.G.</title_clean>
		<plot>The story of Advanced V.G. follows a similar template as those of the previous  Variable Geo games: the strongest young women in the country hold a tournament, which is sponsored by various restaurant chains, which in turn ask the competing girls to pose as waitresses working in said restaurants, for promotional purposes. The girls of the Jahana group who starred in the previous games return, with the new main protagonist being the young martial artist Yuka Takeuchi, who has been training in a secluded forest area before joining the competition. [CR]Like its predecessors, Advanced V.G. is a fighting game, with the basic "kick" and "punch" moves, while the various special attacks are executed by pressing combinations of buttons. There are three modes in the game, "Normal", "Vs.", and "Story". The normal mode is basically training matches between the player character and an AI-controlled girl. Vs. mode allows two-player mode, as well as demo "computer vs. computer" gameplay, with the possibility to choose any of the stages. Any of the eight heroines is available as a playable character in these modes. The story mode, on the other hand, allows the player to control Yuka Takeuchi only, and follow her story. Cut scenes advance the story between matches.</plot>

		<title_clean>Adventure Quiz - Capcom World + Hatena no Daibouken</title_clean>
		<plot>Adventure Quiz is a compilation of two games previously released on the arcades, Capcom World and Hatena? no Daiboken.[CR]Both games play very similarly: the player has to roll dice in order to navigate his/her alter ego on a board with medieval/fantasy backgrounds. Depending on the result, the character advances a certain amount of squares, which lead to various quiz challenges. The player has to answer a series of questions within a time limit, choosing the right answer among the several (usually four) available ones. Two-player gameplay is also possible.[CR]Upon reaching the final square of a "world", the player has to face a "boss enemy" (usually a character from popular games by  Capcom, such as  Side Arms,  Forgotten Worlds, etc.). The boss offers the player a choice of several available topics for the decisive quiz. "Defeating" the boss leads the player into a new worlds with its own structure, etc.[CR]The themes of the questions are varied, ranging from history and geography to Japanese popular culture and very specific themes (such as bicycles).[CR]Hatena? no Daiboken is a follow-up to Capcom World, offering a few enhancements: multiple paths through some worlds, special squares that lead to new challenges (such as a quiz with only three possible answers), etc.</plot>

		<plot>The Cho Aniki series returns with their first sequel, the one that would cement the series humorous fetish with bodybuilders and other assorted stuff. As in the original Cho Aniki: Super Big Brothers, Ai Cho Aniki is a side-scrolling shooter in which you have to clear several stages of enemies with your flying avatar. Said avatar this time can be either of the two "option" bodybuilders that were supporting characters in the original while the original's main cast plays only small cameo roles as they appear every now and then to drop power-ups.[CR]Our two beloved speedo-wearing beefcakes also incorporate different play mechanics, as their attacks are often determined by button combinations (as in fighting games) which put a spin on the gameplay. Otherwise, the game's graphics and design are practically identical to the first game.</plot>

Kenbu encounters other heroes, and together they must stop the evil that is threatening the entire world.[CR]Alnam no Kiba ("Fang of Alnam") is a traditional Japanese RPG. Kenbu and his party roam the top-down world, walking on the world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The battles are viewed from the same top-down perspective as the navigation (like in  Alshark). Every action in battle depletes a certain amount of spirit points. The heroes can use regular attacks, magic, and unite attacks, that do high damage to all enemies, but consume a lot of spirit points.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]OVERVIEW[CR]  Ai's dreams.     Anesan is a beat 'em up featuring an exclusively female cast; you start out with three characters (Ai, Chika, and Makoto) all members of a gang, and you fight other gangs to expand your territory.  Depending on who you use to beat the bosses (generally Ai) some of them will join you afterwards. Each character plays slightly differently and has a different special move. If a character gets KO'd in a stage, they must spend a day of game time recovering (I.E., one stage) before they can be used again. If all characters are KO'd at the same time, it results in a game over.    In addition to the basic beat 'em up mode, it features two mini-games and you can customize Ai's room (which also gives your characters various stat boosts). Sometimes Ai has strange dreams between the stages; this appears to be random.  CONTROLS: These are the basic controls for the beat 'em up portions.  I button: Jump II buttom: attack I and II buttons simultaneously: Special attack (drains some life!) Right or left on the D-pad plus II when close: Throw II plus down on the D-pad over a downed opponent: Stomp. Some characters can't do this.  BONUS GAMES  Anesan features two bonus games which can be accessed between stages.      The horror, the horror!!      The first mini-game which is always accessible is the "Scary Face Grand Prix". The player must rotate the D-pad as quickly as possible to make an incredibly hideous face faster than their opponent. Not all characters can participate in this; some just don't have what it takes to make hideous faces.      The second mini-game is a chicken race. You cannot play this mini-game if you haven't bought a motorcycle. Go as fast and as far as you can towards a concrete wall before you brake.... but don't brake too late![CR]STORY[CR]  Condensed history.       Ai, Chika, and Makoto have long been friends; as children they were ruthlessly bullied by other girls until one day a strong and cool girl gang boss named Yuko beat their bullies senseless and taught them how to stand up for themselves. Since then, they have followed in her footsteps. However, after a recent gang war, Yuko has gone missing! Our heroines set out to find out what happened and establish their gang, "Eden", in other territories.  [CR]CHARACTERS[CR]       Ai: The main protagonist, she is well balanced between power and stamina, and has a fast attack. She apparently likes to write poems, and her favourite colour is purple. Her special attack is some kind of kick/jacket swish. She's probably the best of the default characters.          Chika: The smallest member of our starting trio of friends, she is the fastest. She's still quite tough despite her diminutive size.  Her special involves her generating energy in both hands and striking towards her middle.          Makoto: The largest and strongest of the three, and also the slowest.  Makoto punches rapidly to both her left and right for her special move.         Ruri: A wanna-be idol singer, she's a crybaby and probably shouldn't be in a gang. She is a recruitable character. Her special is simply her elbowing and kneeing the opponent while singing; however, when she's a boss this summons a stampede of fans.           Hirame: An ugly girl whose nickname reflects her fish-like face. She wants to be a ballet dancer of all things, and has surprisingly good posture. Her special attack is a flurry of kicks.          Asuka: A bizarre girl with strabismus, a strange laugh, and a drinking problem. She is easily recruited and is of average speed and strength.  Her special attack involves her drinking and then lighting her breath on fire with a lighter.            The twins, Akane and Izumi: The bosses of the Vixen gang. They're dirty fighters, who like to double-team opponents and use knives. They are recruitable, but it's difficult (possibly the player needs to have purchased the best knife for them to join). Their special is a knife uppercut.         Ryuko: A tough martial artist girl from the dock area. She is fast and strong, and apparently of Chinese descent. Her special move is a short auto-combo; however, as a boss, she charges up and head-bangs around the the area.          Hillary: Called "Hiraly" in the game, she's an American, uses kung fu and is prone to outbursts of questionable English. VERY NO! Her special move is a hopping kick. Her attacks are strange and difficult to utilize.            Soushi: A pretty girl who is devoted to the art of the sword, and who apparently doesn't mind walking around with an open shirt She is another easy recruit, and with her great attack range and attack speed is probably the best character in the game. Her special attack is a sequence of repeated strikes.            Isami: Another bokken user, she can throw projectiles with her sword. She takes losses hard.  She does not appear to be recruitable.        Sayaka:  A blind girl who fights with her cane. She is seemingly recruitable, but you never get a chance to use her as she's only recruited in the final stage. She can create shock waves with the tapping of her cane.          Oni: The final boss, she is (obviously) not recruitable. She can stomp to cause explosions.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Atlas, or The Atlas: Renaissance Voyager as some versions are known, is a strategy-simulation game in which the player has five years to explore and chart the continent of Africa in the 15th century's "Age of Discovery". As the player fills in the map for European scholars, they can also partake in trade for additional funding. The game is heavily focused on decision making and menu navigation.The Atlas was first released for the PC98-01 in 1991 and was quickly ported to other Japanese home computers of the era such as the FM Towns and DOS-based PCs. It eventually saw console ports, first with the PC Engine Super CD-ROM in 1994 and the Super Famicom in 1995. The PC Engine version would also later be added to the Japanese Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console library in 2008. No version of the game has officially been localized into English, though one of the PC versions was localized and released in Germany by Sunflowers Interactive Entertainment Software.The Atlas was followed by a sequel in 1993: The Atlas II. This sequel takes place a century later and now concerns the Americas.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>It is the future, the time of space travel and great society reforms. Fuyuu City is a town built in the middle of space. There is something strange about this city: the entire power is in the hands of women, who are much stronger than the men. Five beautiful, clever, and strong women form a group called "Aurora". They are the ones who control Fuyuu City. You are a nameless guy who winds up in Fuyuu City with his memory lost. You are outraged by what you see in the city, and decide to help the rightless men. It seems that the hero who has the courage to face the Aurora group is finally there...[CR]"Aurora Quest" is a humorous game with deliberately funny, cartoony design of male characters, and beautifully drawn Aurora girls. Despite its humorous character, this is a full-fledged RPG with heroes, villains, and mysteries. You navigate your hero in top-down view, talk to inhabitants, equip weapon and armor, and participate in first person perspective, turn-based battles.</plot>

		<plot>A devastating atomic war wiped out the biggest cities on the Earth and most of its population. Anarchy reigned, different military organizations fighting each other in a new war for dominance. One of such organizations eventually seized control of the planet, establishing itself as a tyrannic government and using advanced technology for military purposes. Only a lone pilot can save humanity from their clutches...[CR]Avenger is a vertically-scrolling shooter, in which the player navigates a plane through levels populated by hostile planes, tanks, cannons, ships, stationary devices, and massive boss enemies. Before each mission, the player can choose among different weapons in three categories: main, sub, and special. Main and sub weapons are fired simultaneously and have unlimited ammunition, while the powerful special attacks are accessed by pressing a different button and are limited. The player can try any combination of the three categories, for example enhancing the main rocket launcher with a pod that fires laser to the sides as a sub weapon, and a protective shield as a special one. Power-ups change properties rapidly, so the player has to catch them at a specific time to enhance either main, sub, or special weapon. Those power-ups do not change the properties of a weapon, but rather give it additional fire power.</plot>

		<plot>The game is based on the comedy TV show Yoshimoto no Shinkigeki, which in its turn is based on a theatrical comedy show popular in Osaka and its surroundings. The game stars characters that either look like the actors from the TV show and/or resemble characters played by them. [CR]The show consists of short episodes which are depictions of comical situations, and are not related to each other story-wise. Same can be applied to the game: there is no real story, just a stretch of hilarious and intentionally impossible situation the protagonists find themselves in.[CR]The setting is deliberately nonsensical, with the locations ranging from typical Japanese suburbs to ancient Japan, town in the American Old West, North Pole, etc. Scenarios are full of anachronisms: for example, one of the protagonists is sent in a space rocket to outer space from a desert near an Old West town, bumps into a planet, and falls back without taking any damage.[CR]Core gameplay is that of a platformer, more precisely an old-fashioned,  Mario-type "jump-and-run". Under normal circumstances, the protagonists have no weapons; the enemies are temporarily paralyzed (not killed) by jumping over their heads.[CR]The game contains a wealth of mini-games, most of which must be completed in order to proceed. The mini-games include: synchronized dancing (through  QTEs), rock-paper-scissors variant with pizza throwing, cowboy-like shoot-outs, and many others.</plot>

		<plot>Dragon's Eye is a conversion of the famous Chinese tile-matching board game known internationally as Shanghai, and is very similar to Shanghai II: Dragon's Eye. The game features versions of both Shanghai and Dragon's Eye for either one or two players, a dozen tile layouts with four sets of tiles (a traditional mahjong set, a medieval fantasy set, traffic signs, and national flags; the Genesis version only has the first two), and several other play options including hints.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The second PC Engine game to be based on Bikkuriman, the first being Bikkuriman World, Bikkuriman Daijikai is less a game and more an interactive database of the various collectible stickers in the Bikkuriman series for fans to peruse at their pleasure. In order to acquire more virtual stickers, the player must answer trivia questions based on the wider world of Bikkuriman, its anime series and other facts relating to the franchise. This unlocks special hologram "head" stickers as well as the next series of regular stickers. The player can also unlock special animated cutscenes that depict famous events in the series' fiction.As the third CD game for the system's new CD-ROM peripheral, developers Hudson were still experimenting with what was possible with the sheer volume of data that CDs were able to handle - almost two thousand times more than the Hucards that other Turbografx-16 games ran on. Bikkuriman Daijikai contains considerably more art assets than many console games available at the time, as well as high quality CD music.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon</title_clean>
		<plot>Based on the popular  manga and anime series, Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon tells the story of a group of Japanese high-school girls, who discover that they have magical abilities, and turn into "sailor" (thanks to the Japanese high-school uniform design) warriors, who must help the inhabitants of the Moon to defeat the evil forces of the Dark Kingdom.[CR]The game is structured like an episode from the series. The player can experience the story through the eyes of five protagonists: Rei, Makoto, Usagi, Ami, and Minako. Their stories merge into one later, but the events are seen each time from the point of view of the respective protagonist.[CR]The game is essentially a visual novel, since the gameplay interventions are very limited and even more sparse than in a typical Japanese-style adventure with its verb commands. The player is able to make choices from time to time, which might alter the subsequent dialogue and/or events; however, the general progression of the story is automatic, without movement or interaction.</plot>

		<plot>According to Blackhole Assault, the 22nd century sees earth technology advance to the point where exploration of the immediate solar system is not only possible, but necessary due to resource constraints. Humans are attempting to harvest the resources of the entire solar system but have met with trouble from alien invaders. It is up to a small force of humans who recognize and understand the threat to confront the aliens head on.[CR]The weapon of choice in this game is the Cybernetic Anthropomorphized Machine, or C.A.M. The C.A.M. is a large robot that fights 1-on-1 against alien robots. All of the gameplay in Blackhole Assault revolves around single-round, 1-on-1 robot fighting action. There are 10 backdrops against which to beat up robots, including various planets and moons around the solar system.[CR]The game has 4 different modes. The main story mode is Operation BHA. The exhibition mode allows players to customize matches down to the robots each player will use and the backdrop to play on. The exhibition mode can be configured to allow one or even both fighters to be controlled by the computer. Further, the game has tournament and league modes.</plot>

		<plot>The Deguna Empire is terrorizing the planets and their inhabitants, using their unbeaten military force consisting of "Powered Gears", giant combat robots piloted by human fighters from the inside. One day, a squad of Empire robots assaulted a laboratory, in which two scientists were working on their own Powered Gear project. One of the scientists, heavily wounded, still managed to deliver a Powered Gear control device to his young apprentice Aref, before he died from his wounds. Enraged, Aref swears revenge to the Empire and everything it represents. With his own new Powered Gear, and perhaps a few allies who think alike, the idea might not be as suicidal as it sounded first...[CR]Blood Gear is a role-playing game with action-based combat. The general gameplay system is somewhat similar to that of the  Exile series: town exploration is performed from the standard "RPG-like" top-down view, while all hostile areas are presented as side-scrolling levels, sometimes with elaborate platform structures. [CR]The player fights enemy robots in real-time combat, similarly to a regular side-scrolling action game. Player-controlled Powered Gear can be equipped with a variety of weapons. Both melee and ranged weapons (pistols, assault rifles, laser guns, etc.) can be purchased in stores and/or found while exploring hostile areas. Health is restored with repair kits of various efficiency, which can also be purchased, found, or randomly dropped by enemies.[CR]Each time an enemy is defeated, the player is rewarded points. There is no separation between money and experience points in this game; the same kind of points is used to buy items, repair and upgrade the Powered Gear. In factories, the player can choose to upgrade the Powered Gear in one of the three categories: body, arms, and legs. Each of these categories has three sub-categories of its own, influencing speed, strength, and other parameters of the body part. Each upgrade cost a certain amount of points; it can also be reversed, and the points invested in another upgrade.[CR]To make "power leveling" possible, enemies re-spawn whenever the player-controlled Powered Gear enters an area, and sometimes even if he walks off the screen and comes back.</plot>

This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.[CR]As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</plot>

		<plot>A mysterious organization has constructed an artificial island in the Atlantic ocean, naming it "Sea Square". Afterwards, they began producing giant combat robots, evidently prepared to build an entire army and become the most dominant military power on the Earth. It's time to stop them! The young hero, piloting a giant combat robot of his own, is sent to Sea Square precisely for that reason...[CR]Browning is a side-scrolling shooter. The player controls the giant robot, equipped with a single gun (with unlimited ammunition), and must fight waves of enemies (mostly of a robotic kind), and eventually the stage boss. Short cut scenes appear between the stages. The player-controlled robot has the ability to hover in the air (the player has to repeatedly press a button to make the robot keep the height). The hit points of the robot depend on the condition of its shield. When the robot stands still, shield energy recharges slowly. Complete loss of shield energy makes the robot so vulnerable that the next hit destroys it. The player is given unlimited continues, but must return to the beginning of the stage each time the robot is destroyed.</plot>

		<plot>The story of this game is quite simple, presented during the intro as a series of short scenes without words. Melba is an easy-going guitar player who is having a picnic with his girlfriend; suddenly, an ultra-strong, evil-looking character appears and kidnaps the poor girl, sailing away on his ship. The brave Melba swims after the ship, and finds a bottle with a map inside. Knowing now the way to the evil kidnapper's lair, Melba embarks on a journey without further hesitation![CR]The premise, the map with the "stages", and the side-scrolling view indicate a platform-type action game; in reality, however, Builderland is a puzzle game, somewhat similar to the famous  Lemmings. As in Lemmings, the player has no control over the protagonist himself (except on a few occasions, when "boss" enemies must be defeated by throwing certain objects at them). Instead, the player must manipulate the environment in order to build a path for Melba, deal with the enemies, etc. Melba is for the most part entirely helpless and simply walks forward automatically. Various items such as boxes, weapons, platforms, etc., must be collected and placed properly in order to save the hero from premature death.</plot>

		<plot>The beautiful planet Kypros, with its lovely view and rich population: humans, gods, intelligent animals... long ago, the god of light Risk and the god of darkness Daar engaged in a prolonged battle which ended with Risk's victory. Bido, the emperor of darkness, tried to revive Daar, but was stopped by the eight legendary heroes, the bearers of eight magical pearls, who united to participate in this cosmic struggle. Peace has returned to Kypros, but not for long. Bido was not completely defeated and is now planning an evil scheme that goes beyond resurrecting Daar. Peace is once again threatened, and the eight heroes have to find each other again and to fight for justice once more![CR]In this direct sequel to  Burai, you control once again the eight heroes - all coming from a different race, culture, and place. Among them is a fearless fighter of the reptile nation, a human sorceress, brother and sister from a tribe of intelligent dog-like creatures, a silver dragon god, and others. You play the personal stories of the heroes as well as their unified struggle. You move the characters on the top-down world map, visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first person perspective.</plot>

		<plot>Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump.</plot>

The game includes a main campaign with introduction and background information about the fictional countries involved in the conflict. In addition, at least a dozen playable maps are included, some representing real geographical areas. The MSX and PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD versions feature enhanced graphics, full-screen battle sequences with backgrounds, and many additional maps.</plot>

		<plot>The Asano family possessed a heirloom known as the Sorcerer's Trump. In the year 1984, however, it was stolen under mysterious circumstances. Seventeen years later, Sayaka, the young heiress of the Asano family, forms a group together with her friends Miki and Kyoko, and the three begin looking for the lost treasure. Heist after heist goes by unsuccessfully. Eventually, the girls organize a TV show, challenging dubious personalities to card games, hoping to find the Sorcerer's Trump in process.&amp;#x0D;[CR]&amp;#x0D;[CR]Cardangels is a card game in which the player takes the roles of the three friends, playing cards against young, attractive female opponents. Four types of card games are available: poker, blackjack, speed, and babanuki (a variant of old maid). A slot machine-like introduction determines which games are played against which opponents. The player can select the amount of rounds (minimum ten) needed to win a game and advance to the next opponent. The "free play" mode allows the player to choose the type of game actively, but the amount of available opponents is lower. There is no gambling in any of the games; points are awarded for combinations in poker and blackjack. The opponents undress after losing a game; however, they retain their underwear - there is no explicit nudity in the game.</plot>

		<plot>A fairly straightforward strategy game that was similar to the Nectaris games on the platform.  The story was based after the events in "Macross: Do You Remember Love", featuring original characters.  The appeal of the game was largely the cinematics and the Macross license, since there were no shortage of generic turn based strategy games at the time.</plot>

		<plot>Choosing to move on with a new story rather than that of the Macross anime, the creators of Macross 2036 brought in the original character designer, Haruhiko Mikimoto, for this horizontal shoot 'em up. The game features extensive anime sequences between levels to recreate the feeling of the show, and these are well drawn although quite heavy in dialogue. The gameplay itself is nothing new - you have a primary weapon and optional secondary weapon that is extra powerful, and you have to mow down the Zentradi forces in your Valkyrie (which only gets to transform at specific points). Power-up pods increase your firepower a little each time, while hidden Minmay heads give extra lives.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cosmic Fantasy 2 is a role playing game developed by Laser Soft and published by both Working Designs (US version) and Nippon Telenet (Japanese version) for the TurboGrafx CD platform. It is the second game in Nippon Telenet's Cosmic Fantasy RPG series, and the only one to see an English localization. The cutscenes from this game and its predecessor were later used to form an OVA (original video animation) disc for the PC Engine CD-ROM called Cosmic Fantasy: Visual Shuu.The player assumes the role of the spear-wielding hunter Van, who discovers his childhood friend and love interest Laura has been kidnapped by an odd and very powerful mage working for an Empire across the ocean. Laura turns out to be a princess in hiding from this empire, and Van decides to chase after her and the mage. Van meets new characters, tracks Laura through various regions and the game eventually moves to outer space and becomes sci-fi.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>This is the third installment of the sci-fi anim role-playing series. Somewhere on the beautiful planet Aira, in a small village Toto lives a young boy named Rei. Rei possesses unique spiritual powers, using which he can heal diseases. One day, Rei is ordered to go to Tristan, the Royal Capital, where he is needed. This seems like a simple journey, but before soon Rei realizes his powers might be needed to help defeating not only intergalactic evil cats Purakki, Gorokki, and Chorokki, but even the mysterious demon Garudo, who recently came to Aira, plotting an evil scheme. [CR]The game is a traditional console-style RPG with turn-based, first person perspective combat. Enemies appear randomly. Rei and other party members can execute various types of techniques and physical attacks in battles, each one with its own strengths and weaknesses. The game features anim-style sequences with voice-overs.[CR]An unusual feature of this game is that instead of separate locations being tied by the usual "world map", there is a continuous world here.</plot>

		<plot>After the first chapter of Cosmic Fantasy 4 described the brave deeds of Y&#363; and his team on the planet Kazarin, it is now the turn of Van, the other great Cosmic Fantasy hero and the protagonist of Cosmic Fantasy 2, to fight the evil forces who threaten the peace of the galaxy. Van awakens after having a nightmare that has been pursuing him after he has left his home planet Idea and joined Cadette Babette (Rim in the Japanese version) as an intergalactic cosmic hunter. However, a meeting with a friend in trouble from convinces him that his quest is just about to begin. Van and his Little Fox Team must return to Idea, and face the shadows of Van's tragic past.The gameplay is virtually identical to that of the first chapter, and has little deviation from the traditional Japanese RPG formula: the player navigates a party of heroes over the top-down world, visiting towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based fashion. Like in the previous game, the  Final Fantasy-like ATB bar indicates the speed of the characters' turns during the battles. The second chapter also opens with a "digital comic" (basically a typical Japanese-style adventure), but after this introduction the RPG gameplay takes over for the rest of the game.</plot>

		<plot>The fourth installment of the sci-fi RPG series comes in two parts, this game being the first. In it, the player once again takes control of the original hero of the series, the cosmic hunter Y&#363;, his lovely female comrade Saya, and their friends. Something is wrong on the planet Kazarin: the princess Saria was kidnapped, and Y&#363; arrives on the planet to look closer into that matter, while Saya agrees to impersonate the princess for a while to ensure a calm investigation. However, their quest goes far beyond the kidnapping investigation: soon they will have to face the four heavenly kings, demons who control the elements from which the universe is built.The game features a role-playing system similar to the first three installments of the series and other Japanese RPGs: the player navigates a party of characters (up to four active combatants) around the top-down overworld, visiting towns, buying equipment, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. A new introduction to the series is an ATB (active-time battle) bar (which came to prominence after having been first implemented by Final Fantasy IV): the player can only execute an action when the bar of the character in question is filled; therefore, switching between characters and reacting quickly becomes a necessity. The game begins with a "digital comic" introduction typical for most Japanese adventures (with menu commands to interact with still anime-style pictures); however, this gameplay mode disappears shortly afterwards and plays no further role.The mild erotic elements characteristic of the previous episodes have been somewhat intensified in this installment; a few scenes feature nudity in context of a sexual situation.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Davis Cup Tennis (Davis Cup World Tour) is a tennis game from Loriciel. It uses a lower-than-normal perspective to depict the tennis court, with the camera a few feet above the ground behind the player character. The Genesis version uses software scaling to change the angle of the court if the player moves far enough to the left or right.The game has multiple modes, including doubles and a tournament mode as well as the Davis Cup itself, and each of the playable characters represents an international team. Though the athletes are only known by their first names for licensing reasons, it's clear enough from examples like "Jimmy" (who represents the USA) who they are meant to be.The game was released on the TurboGrafx-16 exclusively in the US in 1991, developed by Loriciel and published by NEC directly. A TurboGrafx-CD version of the game was released the following year, but only in Japan. In 1993, Tengen published an enhanced version of the same game for the Genesis in the US, Japan, Europe and Australia. In Europe and Australia, the game is known as Davis Cup World Tour.AthletesThe following 32 athletes are in the TurboGrafx-16 version of the game."John" - USA"Jimmy" - USA"Boris" - Germany"Carl Uwe" - Germany"Zlatko" - Yugoslavia"Dvoran" - Yugoslavia"Carlos" - Argentina"Jose" - Argentina"Rod" - Australia"Pat" - Australia"Heinz" - Austria"Franz" - Austria"Ivan" - Czechslovakia"Miroslav" - Czechslovakia"Yannick" - France"Henri" - France"Berd" - The Netherlands"Niel" - The Netherlands"Shlomo" - Israel"Aaron" - Israel"Adriano" - Italy"Claudio" - Italy"Ramon" - Mexico"Diego" - Mexico"Carl" - New Zealand"Michael" - New Zealand"Miguel" - Spain"Angel" - Spain"Stefan" - Sweden"Mats" - Sweden"Rodolf" - Switzerland"Ugo" - Switzerland [CR]</plot>

		<plot>DEJA is a remake of the  computer game of the same name, a Japanese style detective/mystery adventure with adult scenes.[CR]The remake features higher-quality graphics; some locations/characters were re-drawn from scratch, sometimes to the point of looking differently from the original design. Voice acting was added to the dialogues. Some cut scenes were added, or altered by including animated sequences. [CR]Text and gameplay remain largely the same. The verb commands are now represented by graphical icons, but object sub-menus look exactly the same as in the original version, and generally the gameplay progression hasn't been changed.[CR]Scenes with adult content have been removed from this remake, though the abundance of sexual innuendos in the dialogue and even gameplay mechanics ("Touch" command etc.) are still there.</plot>

		<title_clean>Death Bringer - The Knight of Darkness</title_clean>
		<plot>A powerful wizard, yearning for even more power, has found a sacred book that granted him command over armies of demons and men. Possessed by the desire to conquer and to destroy, he orders his armies to set cities on fire, massacring the citizens. But one nameless hero, the protagonist of this game, has to stand up against the evil. Leaving Soron, his home village, the hero embarks on a journey to find companions and to face together the forces of darkness.[CR]Despite being a Japanese game, Death Bringer is more similar to Western RPGs of the time than to their Japanese counterparts, even though it has anime-style character graphics. It is less event-oriented than Japanese games and focuses on exploration. The gameplay is somewhat similar to  Pandora's  RPG of the same name, even though the two games are unrelated. Both friendly and hostile areas are pseudo-3D, maze-like environments, like in  Bard's Tale games. Enemy encounters, however, are handled more similarly to those of  Ultima: the enemies appear on the exploration screen, and the battle initiates only if the player character approaches the enemy. The battles take place on a top-down field; the heroes and the enemies move around, but the player can't navigate the characters manually: it is only possible to issue commands such as "Attack", "Use Magic", etc. The game has a day/night cycle. Party members (up to three, excluding the hero) have to be sought out in various cities, rather then joining the hero for plot-related reasons.</plot>

		<title_clean>Dekoboko Densetsu - Hashiru Wagamanmaa</title_clean>
		<plot>Dekoboko Densetsu is a humorous game that combines elements of arcade action and racing. Up to five players can compete in the races. All the stages are vertically-scrolling (top-down), with the cars represented as small sprites of different colors. The player's goal is not only to beat the other cars, but also reach the finish line safely: each car has limited hit points, and continuously receives damage during the race.[CR]Damage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs, etc.), failing to move the car forward in time (if the screen scrolls while the player-controlled car is at the bottom, it takes damage), being hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy fire, avoiding damage.[CR]Over the course of the races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in purchasing a limited amount of destructive weaponry (missiles, bombs, "boxing glove" that hits enemies from the side, oil to drop behind the car, etc.) or protective measures.</plot>

		<plot>Four beautiful sisters - Foltjunia, Eindebelle, Leamuroda, and Crealidelle - fight an evil alien race known as Bestia in deep space, transforming into powerful robotic machines. One day, Foltjunia is attacked and ends up unconscious on the pavement in one of the cities in Japan, planet Earth. There, she is found by a regular high-school student named Takaya. It appears that Foltjunia has lost her transformation abilities. Her sisters decide to stay with Takaya for a while, masquerading as high-school girls, which greatly complicates the young man's social and romantic life.Having the same characters and initial plot as Hatsukoi Monogatari, Denn&#333; Tenshi: Digital Ange is a Japanese-style adventure game with very limited interaction and strictly linear progression. Most screens allow the player to choose verb commands such as "Look", "Talk", "Watch", "Go", etc. from a menu, usually combining them with character and object names in a sub-menu. Typically, going through most or all options triggers the next event.</plot>

		<title_clean>Double Dragon II - The Revenge</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Double Dragon II centers around the murder of MarianOriginally released in 1988 as an arcade game, Double Dragon II: The Revenge is the sequel to Double Dragon, which was released in 1987. Double Dragon II once again stars Jimmy and Billy Lee as they investigate the murder of Marian, the love interest of the series. Marian was shot to death by a group known as the Black Warriors. Other than the original arcade release, there have been a variety of home console versions, including releases for the NES, Game Boy, Genesis, TurboGrafx-16, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, and Amiga. These versions all differ in a variety of ways, from minor elements to major gameplay changes.On March 10, 1990, Meldac released the soundtrack of Double Dragon II: The Revenge in Japan. Featuring new renditions of the songs from the NES version of the game, including arranged songs and a pop remix of the opening theme, with vocals sung by Manami Morozumi. The soundtrack, composed by Kazuhiro Hara and Nobuhito Tanahashi, contains 13 songs, two of which are different renditions of the same song (Dead or Alive, one with lyrics and one without).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade Version The first level in the arcade game.The original arcade release is essentially the same as its predecessor. The game is a side scrolling beat-em-up, in which players can fight enemies across a four stages: an airport, lumberhouse, a field, and the base of operations for the Black Warriors. The largest differences between the original Double Dragon and Double Dragon II are improved moves, range of attack, and control scheme. In Double Dragon, players could either kick or punch. Double Dragon II changes this, and opts instead for directional based attacks (e.g. if the player is facing to the right, one button will send out a flurry of punches and the other button will have the character kick from the back).In addition to friendly characters, all of the enemies have received significant makeovers as well. As well as a range of new enemy characters (including the final boss, Willy, leader of the Black Warriors), enemies now have new weapons to carry around and use, including shovels and hand grenades. Enemy attacks are also modified, including a new range of combos and special attacks (to combat the new moves that Jimmy and Billy have received, such as the Hurricane Kick).NES Version The only way to get the true ending in the NES version is to play the game on hard.Possibly the most well known version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge, the NES version was originally released on December 23, 1989 in Japan, and then later released in North America during January of 1990. Published by Acclaim Entertainment and developed by Technos, Double Dragon II for the NES is very different from the arcade version on which it is based. Similar to the previous NES game, Double Dragon, this NES game is a one to two player side scrolling beat-em-up, although this was the first version of a Double Dragon game on the NES that could be played by two players simultaneously in co-op. The game has an expanded story, including cutscenes before each stage (of which there are nine). In addition, there is a separate final boss in the NES version, which can only be fought on the hardest difficult level. Upon being defeated, Marian is brought back to life (unlike the arcade version).The Lee brothers retain the bi-directional attacks from the arcade version (with B and A on the NES pad corresponding to Left and Right attacks, respectively) as well as the spinning Hurricane Kick special move. In addition, they can execute "hyper" uppercut and "hyper" flying knee attacks, which send enemies flying skyward and backwards, respectively. The latter move is particularly useful for making quick work of enemies (including boss characters) when fighting near a bottomless pit area. While the Hurricane Kick can be executed on the fly by jumping and then tapping both buttons at the peak of the jump, the latter two must be executed by timing button presses almost perfectly when the player character is just exiting his kneeling frame of animation (initiated by either landing from a jump or getting up from a fall), making them slightly more complex moves to pull off.Stage design (as well as several new stages with story sequences playing out before each one), modes, and the plot changes are all among the differences between the arcade and NES versions of Double Dragon II. Arguably the largest change is the addition of a two-player "Mode B", where the players can damage each other during the game - this factor was subsequently used to discover a number of exploits and shortcuts by the speedrun community. (Another side effect of "Mode B" was that if one player killed another, the first player would gain the life that the other player lost, something that could be used to give a single player up to 7 lives.) Additionally, Double Dragon II on the NES adds five new stages, differing enemies, radically different stage design, and a new final boss (named the Mysterious Warrior).Other VersionsOther than the well-known arcade and NES versions, there have been a variety of other ports of Double Dragon II: The Revenge. Two other home console ports were produced in 1991 and 1993 (both exclusively in Japan) for the Sega Mega Drive and the PC Engine respectively. The Mega Drive version is largely unchanged from the arcade game, only slightly altering the second stage. The PC Engine version featured upgraded graphics (including the story sequences from the NES version, which are redone for this version), new music, slightly altered stage design, and voice acting for the main characters, including Billy, Jimmy, and Marian.Several ports were released for PC platforms as well, with Virgin Mastertronic and Binary Design handling ports to the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, IBM PC, Commodore Amiga, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST in 1989. These companies were the same companies to handle the PC ports of the original Double Dragon as well.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR] Double Dragon II's arranged soundtrackDead or Alive (2:48)The Vengeful Demon has Begun to Move (3:37)A Quiet Pursuit (3:01)Tension at the Night Sky (1:43)Advancing Towards Sunset (2:25)Escape to the Forest (3:43)Wicked God (1:25)Breaking the Barrier (2:37)Enter to the Enemy's Base (3:19)Roar of the Twin Dragons (3:55)Miracle of the Twin Dragons (1:25)Sweet Memories (3:13)[CR]</plot>

		<plot>In D&#333;ky&#363;sei, the player takes the role of a high-school student (default name Takurou) in a Japanese town; his parents have just moved into a large mansion in a good district. The boy has to go to the new school, but his mind is preoccupied with one subject only: pretty girls. Instead of studying hard, Takurou decides to explore the city and to find out more about its female inhabitants.D&#333;ky&#363;sei is more interactive than most other Japanese adventures, utilizing point-and-click interface (with context-sensitive icons for talking, touching, etc.) and featuring free top-down navigation through the town and the school building. The hero can enter restaurants, shops, cafe houses, etc. It is also possible to take a train to another district and explore it. The game has an internal clock; a visit to any location (including separate rooms of a building, etc.) "costs" twenty minutes of the game time. The purpose of the game is to learn where and when the fourteen "datable" girls usually are. Many of the conversations with the girls feature multiple answers; the success in many cases depends on the player's choices.The game has scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.</plot>

During the game, Gohan is telling Goten stories about                    Goku, his father, who died before he was born. As each story                    is told, it is your job to play out the battles as they occurred                    in the series. Cinematics help to tell the stories in graphic                    detail. Other characters from the series will occasionally come                    to help Gohan tell the stories. [CR]</plot>

		<plot>Mink is a young girl who discovers that she has dragon blood, and is destined to seal away the evil demon Azetodeth. The only way to do that is use the sacred Gourd, which, in its turn, can be made only after having acquired three sacred artifacts. Together with her friends Lufa, Pia, and Princess Vina, Mink embarks on a quest for the artifacts, hoping to defeat Azetodeth once and for all![CR]This interpretation of Ryuusuke Mita's manga Dragon Half is entirely different from the  computer version. It is a combination of a board game and an RPG. Up to 4 players can compete, each controlling a party of characters from the manga. The navigation takes place on a large board, and is controlled by dice rolls. The player can advance only as many steps as the number on the dice; however, most of the board has many different paths and crossroads, which allows certain freedom of movement and planning. [CR]Different spots on the board have a variety of effects on the party. Red-colored spots lead to turn-based enemy encounters. The player must press a button in time to choose an attack by a specific party member, and also to determine its strength. Experience points are rewarded after battles, and the characters level up in a fashion similar to other Japanese RPGs.[CR]Other places on the board include damage traps, shops, trigger meetings with other characters, lead to healing spots such as pools and hotels.</plot>

		<plot>Strawberry Fields - a magic country populated almost exclusively by beautiful young girls (that is, if we don't count the Wise Old Man and a couple of other male exceptions). All went well in this peaceful place, until the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country's lovely inhabitants and placed a curse upon them, turning them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might knows as Desmond, the hero of Knights of Xentar), a young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the curse one has to find three sacred writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be very grateful![CR]Dragon Knight II is the predecessor to Knights of Xentar, the only Dragon Knight game that was ever translated into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. Takeru has to explore the three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various people.</plot>

		<title_clean>Dragon Knight III</title_clean>
		<plot>This version of Dragon Knight III is based on the earlier computer release, known in the West as Knights of Xentar. While retaining the story, the graphical style, and the basic location layout of the computer version, this release has substantial gameplay differences.Unlike in the computer version, the battles are not real-time, but turn-based, and utilize a different perspective; randomly encountered enemies are fought in a first-person, Dragon Quest-like traditional Japanese RPG style. Enemy design is also quite different; many of the monsters from the original version have been replaced with female characters. The graphics in the top-down areas have been slightly enhanced.This version also censors the adult content. The scenes are still suggestive, but there is no explicit nudity in them any more. Some of the cutscenes have been completely re-drawn, eliminating even implicit sexual activity.</plot>

		<plot>Years have passed since prince Selios, the hero of the first game, defeated the demon god Agunija in the ultimate battle. Peace returned to the land of Iseruhasa. Selios married his sweetheart Dina, and they had a child, whom they gave the name Atlas. At the age of fifteen, Atlas was already a strong warrior, thanks to the lessons of his teacher Lowel. Everything seemed peaceful in the country, until two warriors spotted strange creatures near the capital city. Those were... men in space suits! Of course, the warriors could not have known this and believed them to be monsters. Do the mysterious strangers have peaceful intentions, or are they a new threat to the kingdom?[CR]The second "Dragon Slayer" is very similar to the first game, graphically and gameplay-wise. The only major difference is the fact that the enemies are now completely visible on screen before battles, so that the player can avoid fighting them if he wants to. Otherwise, it is a traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. The Genesis version has once again updated graphics.</plot>

Fades, as he calls himself, faithful to Natas, enters the throne of King Oddesia and demands the relinquishment of the Orb. With King Earl II dead and the Orb in the hands of evil, Oddesia was once again in grave danger.[CR]At the same time, Princess Miriam of Solis was visiting Ardeen and was taken hostage by Mynos the Man-Bull. As the game supports five players, you enter the throne room of Ardeen as one or more of the five to-be Immortals, with a character class of your choice: Fighter, Thief, Wizard, Cleric, Bard, Hunter, Dwarf or the Elf.[CR]Dungeon Explorer II plays very similarly to its prequel. You move around and talk to people in a regular RPG fashion. Since the movement is not limited to squares and you can move diagonally, the game has very action-oriented gameplay. You fight enemies as you would in The Legend of Zelda or Gauntlet, from a top-town view. Enemies spawn from Generators and drop usable items, power-ups and provide experience as you kill them. Items are used in real-time and leveling up gives you more health.[CR]New to Dungeon Explorer II, the game takes full advantage of the CD format. It includes full voice-acted dialogue instead of common subtitled dialogue. The game also includes fully digitalized music tracks, played from the game CD, as well as video sequences as introductional videos in TurboGrafx-CD fashion.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dungeon Master: Theron's Quest is a re-imagining of FTL Games's original Dungeon Master. Though it uses the same art assets and the combat/magic systems of the original game, Theron's Quest has a new story with intro and outro cutscenes, and changes the game's focus from exploring one huge dungeon and stopping Lord Chaos to exploring seven different dungeons to recover pieces of a fantastical set of armor.The game's story focuses on Theron, a young shepherd who was late to his coming of age ceremony. To prove himself a man, he agrees to the request of the powerful wizard The Gray Lord (he who would become Lord Chaos in the original game) to seek out parts of the suit of armor known as the Seven Symbols of the Brave. To do so, he needs to explore seven different dungeons, each containing a part and protected by an evil creature.Each dungeon is treated as a separate scenario. Any items obtained or skill increases gained by recruited champions are scrapped after completing the dungeon; the only constant is Theron himself, who grows more powerful to match the greater challenge the later dungeons present. The goal of each dungeon is to find the named relic and return it to the dungeon's starting point. Each dungeon has its own characteristics and dangers, though most of the monsters and level design is based on the dungeon of the original game (and occasionally from its official expansion pack Chaos Strikes Back).Theron's Quest is exclusive to the TurboGrafx-CD platform. It was published in Japan by Victor Interactive in late 1992, and by Turbo Technologies in North America the following year.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...[CR]The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.</plot>

		<plot>In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...[CR]The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game is a sequel to XZR and part of the Exile / XZR series. It was originally released as XZR II for the MSX2, PC-88 and PC-98 computer platforms in 1988.Exile received a full 16-bit remake in 1991, featuring cutscenes and a brand new Red Book soundtrack. Renovation Products handled the Genesis version, whereas Working Designs localized the Turbo CD version. The dungeons were less difficult to navigate in the 16-bit versions; the original MSX2 version's were maze-like, so it was easier to lose one's way. The game's soundtrack was composed by Shinobu Ogawa and Tenpei Sato.Like its predecessor, the gameplay contains heavy drug use, with drugs being used instead of potions. These drugs, however, have side-effects, such as stat and health abnormalities and sometimes even death. Many of these drug references were censored for the North American releases, however.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]In a war-torn Middle-Eastern land ravaged by a century of religious Crusades, a force of evil has emerged to prey on the weak and defenseless people. As Sadler, a battle-hardened veteran of the Holy Wars, you have answered the call to defend the people and rid the once peaceful land of the dreaded "Masters of Evil".The plot of the game detailed the further adventures of Sadler, taking place after the events of XZR. Now living in the time of the Christian Crusades, Sadler makes an attempt to unite the world under one God and achieve world peace. Along the way, he performs several rituals and fights various Hindu and Buddhist deities.Sadler meets the head of the Knights Templar, Hugues de Payens, and helps him search for the Holimax, a holy artefact. Sadler travels to several different countries, including France (where his love interest Rumi is kidnapped), India, Cambodia, and Japan. In a Cambodian temple, Sadler resurrects the Persian Manichaean prophet Mani. In Japan, Sadler rescues Ninkan, who in real life was head of Japanese sex cult Tachikawa-ryu. Afterwards, Sadler travels back in time to Eden and meets Bacchus. Sadler also murders Hiram Abiff, a Masonic figure. After defeating Jubelum of the Three Ruffians, Sadler receives the Holimax. Although the console versions end there, the computer versions continue the story, having Sadler warp to present-day Manhattan, where he fights skateboarding punks and zombies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the TG-CD version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 7,8,7,7, adding, "...Working Designs has established a reputation for quality software, and this disc demonstrates how good a CD RPG can be. This quest is challenging and not linear as some of the newer ones are".[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Project F is a managerial simulation that puts the player in the role of the owner of a Formula 1 company. The player is responsible for paying salary to managers, mechanics, and other members of the staff; it is possible to raise or lower the salary, which may lead to various consequences depending on the employee's personality. Then the player makes contract with one or more drivers, selecting them from a list. Car customization plays an important role. Gasoline, engines, chassis, wheels, tires, brakes, and other components must be purchased from manufacturers of the player's choice. The racing competition itself is non-interactive. Tournament events follow depending on its schedule, and the player simply watches how the race unfolds and ends according to the participants' parameters. Brand and player names in the game resemble real ones, but have been slightly altered for copyright reasons.</plot>

		<plot>In Meikyu no Elfeane, the player takes the role of a real person - the Japanese singer and actress Tomomi Nishimura - in her hand-drawn, "super-deformed", anime-style, top-down-viewed incarnation (digitized photos of the real Ms. Nishimura can be seen during some of the game's cut scenes). In the game, Tomomi is just a simple girl who works in a restaurant, but gets magically transported to a fairy land. There, she must first protect the inhabitants of a peaceful town from goblin onslaught, and ultimately find a way to return to the real world. [CR]Despite the top-down view and the fact it was developed y the same  company who have brought us distinguished Turbo CD RPGs such as  Cosmic Fantasy series and  Babel, Meikyu no Elfeane is not a RPG, but an adventure - Japanese-style, with minimum puzzles. Most of the gameplay involves running around and talking to various inhabitants of the fairy world. There are also mini-games: a  Pac-Man-like game with cars, a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up, a  Breakout clone, and a quiz show.</plot>

		<title_clean>Fantastic Night Dreams - Cotton</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fantastic Night Dreams: Cotton is a shoot 'em up and is the first in a series of games starring the titular character, Cotton. Featuring entertaining cutscenes (in some versions these are voiced, as well!) it had a relatively well developed story in terms of shoot 'em ups for the era.Developed by Success Corp., Cotton was originally released in the Arcades by Sega in 1991. It was ported to the PC Engine CD-ROM2 in 1993 where it was given a whole new redbook audio soundtrack. This version was ported to the US later the same year. It was also ported to the Sharp X68000 Japanese home computer that year as well. Later versions would hit the Neo Geo Pocket Color and the PS1: Cotton Original, the PS1 version, uses the soundtrack of the TurboGrafx-CD version and the graphics of the original Arcade game, making it a "best of both worlds" edition of the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Silk the fairy acts as an "option" for Cotton and follows and attacks with her; Cotton can get additional fairies. Cotton also has two types of shots, a basic forward magical attack and magical "bombs", resembling bubbles she drops at an angle in front of her. Various types of magic serve as Cotton's powerful special attacks; these are limited by the number you have in stock.ItemsMost power ups take the form of gems (&#23453;&#30707;/houseki) dropped by enemies; these can be shot by Cotton to change their color and consequently the effect they have when picked up. Larger gems are (of course) worth more of whatever the particular color grants. Most special items (like the fairy stones and bomb power ups) are carried by strange statues seen throughout the game. Don't destroy their heads when they leave the screen; they'll come back holding a power up!GemsA medium yellow gem. Yellow: Yellow gems are worth bonus points.Orange: Orange gems grant Cotton experience, powering up her weapons.Red: Gives Cotton one or more red magic stocks.Blue: Gives Cotton a blue magic stock.Other ItemsA bomb level up. Bomb level up 1: Levels up Cotton's bombs by one.Bomb level up 2: Levels up Cotton's bombs by two.Fairy Stone: Gives Cotton an extra fairy familiar in addition to Silk!White Tea: Only found at the bonus segment after a boss is defeated. Worth 100 points.Red Tea: Also only found at the bonus segment after a boss is defeated. Worth 500 points.Magic SpellsFire Dragon: Cotton fires a dragon made of fire straight forward. This costs a stock of red magic.Thunder: Cotton fires a powerful lightning bolt straight forward which remains active for some time. This costs a stock of blue magic.Fire Silk: Silk and any other fairies you have are engulfed in fire and charge at the enemies. This costs a stock of red magic.Barrier: Temporarily protects Cotton from enemy projectiles. This costs a stock of blue magic.Special Attack: All of Cotton's fairies attack the enemies. This is performed only when you have no magic stocks.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A wave of darkness from the world of monsters has tainted the light prism which brings light and happiness to the land of fairies; on top of that, the only thing that can restore the prism are seven magical candies called willows... which happen to have been stolen by the strongest of the monsters! Silk is sent by the fairy queen to find help, but all she manages to find is a strange, air-headed and mildly insane witch named Cotton. Silk uses Cotton's obsession with candy to trick her in to retrieving all the willows and restoring light to the fairy kingdom; throughout the game she frequently has to prevent Cotton from eating the willows.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Stage 1.Stage 1: A ruined town. Cotton travels over a lake at night, a baleful moon glowering down upon the land.

		<title_clean>Fantastic Night Dreams - Cotton</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fantastic Night Dreams: Cotton is a shoot 'em up and is the first in a series of games starring the titular character, Cotton. Featuring entertaining cutscenes (in some versions these are voiced, as well!) it had a relatively well developed story in terms of shoot 'em ups for the era.Developed by Success Corp., Cotton was originally released in the Arcades by Sega in 1991. It was ported to the PC Engine CD-ROM2 in 1993 where it was given a whole new redbook audio soundtrack. This version was ported to the US later the same year. It was also ported to the Sharp X68000 Japanese home computer that year as well. Later versions would hit the Neo Geo Pocket Color and the PS1: Cotton Original, the PS1 version, uses the soundtrack of the TurboGrafx-CD version and the graphics of the original Arcade game, making it a "best of both worlds" edition of the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Silk the fairy acts as an "option" for Cotton and follows and attacks with her; Cotton can get additional fairies. Cotton also has two types of shots, a basic forward magical attack and magical "bombs", resembling bubbles she drops at an angle in front of her. Various types of magic serve as Cotton's powerful special attacks; these are limited by the number you have in stock.ItemsMost power ups take the form of gems (&#23453;&#30707;/houseki) dropped by enemies; these can be shot by Cotton to change their color and consequently the effect they have when picked up. Larger gems are (of course) worth more of whatever the particular color grants. Most special items (like the fairy stones and bomb power ups) are carried by strange statues seen throughout the game. Don't destroy their heads when they leave the screen; they'll come back holding a power up!GemsA medium yellow gem. Yellow: Yellow gems are worth bonus points.Orange: Orange gems grant Cotton experience, powering up her weapons.Red: Gives Cotton one or more red magic stocks.Blue: Gives Cotton a blue magic stock.Other ItemsA bomb level up. Bomb level up 1: Levels up Cotton's bombs by one.Bomb level up 2: Levels up Cotton's bombs by two.Fairy Stone: Gives Cotton an extra fairy familiar in addition to Silk!White Tea: Only found at the bonus segment after a boss is defeated. Worth 100 points.Red Tea: Also only found at the bonus segment after a boss is defeated. Worth 500 points.Magic SpellsFire Dragon: Cotton fires a dragon made of fire straight forward. This costs a stock of red magic.Thunder: Cotton fires a powerful lightning bolt straight forward which remains active for some time. This costs a stock of blue magic.Fire Silk: Silk and any other fairies you have are engulfed in fire and charge at the enemies. This costs a stock of red magic.Barrier: Temporarily protects Cotton from enemy projectiles. This costs a stock of blue magic.Special Attack: All of Cotton's fairies attack the enemies. This is performed only when you have no magic stocks.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A wave of darkness from the world of monsters has tainted the light prism which brings light and happiness to the land of fairies; on top of that, the only thing that can restore the prism are seven magical candies called willows... which happen to have been stolen by the strongest of the monsters! Silk is sent by the fairy queen to find help, but all she manages to find is a strange, air-headed and mildly insane witch named Cotton. Silk uses Cotton's obsession with candy to trick her in to retrieving all the willows and restoring light to the fairy kingdom; throughout the game she frequently has to prevent Cotton from eating the willows.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Stage 1.Stage 1: A ruined town. Cotton travels over a lake at night, a baleful moon glowering down upon the land. The stage mini-boss is a giant stone head; the boss is ALSO a stone head with multiple faces, called a "face idol".Stage 2: A forest. Cotton encounters a tree mini-boss in this stage; the stage boss is called "Death".Stage 3: A dark and scary mountain. There is a flaming hound as a mini-boss; the stage boss is a giant snake woman called Medusa.Stage 4: A dark temple. The mini-boss is a monstrous plant; the boss is a giant, multi-stage statue called Sphinx.Stage 5: A castle of monsters! A pair of giant crabs are a mini-boss here. The boss is a terrifying plant-man growing in to the castle itself.Stage 6: A subterranean volcano. The mini-boss is a pair of demons; the boss is a terrible dragon.Stage 7: A battle with the final boss, a demon lady who is the leader of the monsters. She wants to eat all the willows herself! Will Cotton finally get to eat the willows? Or will Silk successfully deliver them to the queen and have light restored to the land of fairies? Find out![CR]</plot>

		<plot>Once upon a time, the brave warriors of the Fire Clan fought the dark lord Masakado and defeated him, saving the beautiful land of Jipang. Many years later, the followers of the Daimon Cult tried to resurrect Masakado, but were defeated by the thief Ziria and other descendants of the Fire Clan. A young boy named Kabuki, who fought together with Manjimaru in the  previous game and helped him to defeat the guardians of the Dark Orchids, receives a letter from Orochimaru, one of the heroes of the battle against Daimon Cult. It seems that the followers of this evil organization have raised their ugly heads again! Several young girls are kidnapped, and Orochimaru suspects it was the work of Daimon Cult. Kabuki, this looks like an adventure for you![CR]The third game in  Tengai Makyo series has an even more distinct humorous undertone and features even more wacky anim-style cut scenes. Gameplay-wise, it is a traditional Japanese RPG with party members, towns, dungeons, and random enemy encounters. Unlike the two previous games, the battles are fought from top-down third person perspective.</plot>

		<title_clean>Fiend Hunter</title_clean>
		<plot>Feed Sluster is a fiend hunter: a man who takes job that involves elimination of mysterious beings known as fiends. One day he is contacted by a woman named Beth, who offers him a more demanding job, which involves investigating shady activities between humans and fiends, and getting to the bottom of the entire mystery, discovering the origin of the fiends and determine their ultimate fate.Fiend Hunter is a cinematic platformer set in an Old West-like environment with supernatural elements. With the exception of the initial town and a few other locations, the game is spent in areas that require carefully navigating Feed through a series of platform-like structures. Controls and animation resemble those of Prince of Persia. Feed can jump, run, perform a running jump, hang on ledges, pull up or drop down, kneel and crawl. He also takes falling damage; the primary challenge during platforming sequences consists of preventing him from falling down.Enemies only appear at pre-set points; each battle is one-on-one, and it is impossible to escape from a fight. Coupled with the enemies' high HP count and varied attack patterns, this essentially turns each encounter into a boss battle. Feed fights with a sword and can perform various moves, combining attacks with jumping and ducking. He can also gain access to a few magic spells.A little fire fiend named Exy accompanies Feed on his journey. Exy can be used as offensive and defensive enhancement in combat, and can also be set to light dark areas. Each enemy drops a special orb that can be used to increase Feed's vitality, attack power, or magic, as well as teach Exy more powerful attacks, which gives the game a light RPG flavor. Feed can also equip rings and buy or find health-restoring and protective potions.</plot>

		<title_clean>Fighting Street</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Street Fighter is a 2D fighting game developed and released by  Capcom for arcades in 1987. The first in a long-spanning fighting game series of the same name, it follows either martial artists Ryu or Ken as they participate in a worldwide martial arts tournament.While it did not achieve the same popularity as its sequels (particularly  Street Fighter II), it introduced many elements to the then-bare fighting game genre (including a six-button control scheme and special command-based techniques). Along with Ryu and Ken, the game introduced a variety of opponents that would return to the series as playable fighters (including Sagat, Gen, Adon, Birdie, and Eagle).Two arcade cabinets were sold for this game: regular and deluxe. The regular version (which was sold as a tabletop cabinet in Japan and an upright cabinet overseas) featured the same six-button configuration (three for punches and three for kicks) used in most of Capcom's later fighting games. The deluxe version featured two pressure-sensitive pads (one for punches and one for kicks), determining the strength and speed of the player's attacks based on how hard the pads were pressed. This is the only fighting game to utilize pressure-sensitive pads for attacks.The port for the  TurboGrafx CD (known as Fighting Street) was the first game released on that system, utilizing an arranged soundtrack. Because the console did not have any six-button configurations, the strength and speed of the attacks were determined by how long each of the action buttons were pressed. The game was also ported to the  Commodore 64,  ZX Spectrum,  Amstrad CPC,  MS-DOS,  Amiga, and  Atari ST. There were actually two ports to the Commodore 64, one by Capcom USA and one by Tiertex in the UK (who went on to develop the unofficial sequel,  Human Killing Machine). The original arcade version was included in Capcom Arcade Hits Volume 1 for the PC,  Capcom Classics Collection Remixed for the  PlayStation Portable, and  Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 for the  Xbox and  PlayStation 2.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]Single player mode can be played as Ryu (when playing as the left player) or as Ken (when playing as the right player). A second player could join at any time and challenge the first player. Depending on the arcade configuration, the player can choose between either two or four nations to start off with (Japan, U.S.A., England, or China). The player must battle through all eight opponents, two from each nation, in order to reach the two boss characters from Thailand.Special MovesStreet Fighter is the first fighting game to provide a secret move list with special command-based abilities. The game debuts three now-iconic special moves: Hadouken (known in international versions as "Ball of Fire") - The original fighting game fireball technique, done by holding down on the joystick, then moving forward in the direction of the opponent, then pressing a punch button. (Known as "quarter-circle forward punch" (QCF-P), or the "fireball motion") Shoryuken (known in international versions as "Dragon Punch") - Jumping uppercut attack, done by moving the joystick towards the opponent, then down, then down and towards the opponent, then pressing a punch button. (Known as the "Z-motion", or "dragon punch motion" (DP-P)) Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku (known in international versions as "Hurricane Kick") - A horizontally moving kick attack, done by holding down on the joystick, then moving away in the opposite direction of the opponent, then pressing a kick button. (Known as "quarter-circle back kick" (QCB-K), or the "hurricane kick motion")In the international versions of the game, the voices of Ryu and Ken were dubbed so that they yelled the names of their moves in English instead of Japanese. This is the only Street Fighter game in the series to do this.[CR]Opponents[CR]JapanRetsuGekiU.S.A.JoeMikeEnglandBirdieEagleChinaLeeGenThailandAdonSagat [CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Final Zone II is a top down shooter developed by Renovation Game and published by NEC Technologies (Telenet Japan Co. in Japan) for the TurboGrafx-CD platform.It continues from the original Final Zone, set several years later. Harward Bowie, Momoko Ring and Randy Hansen return, and the sequel's story concerns a conspiracy that involves the destruction of Bowie's ship just before he and his military squad are about to begin a mission. The survivors face the hostile force on the planet they were about to strike from orbit, but this is revealed to be a misdirect and the game's plot continues to twist and turn.Like the first game, the game uses a top-down perspective similar to Last Alert or Ikari Warriors. Instead of being commandos, however, the playable characters all fight in N.A.P.s, or New Age Power-Suits. These versatile mech suits provide them with a lot more maneuverability and firepower, and are different for each character (they can be told apart by their bright colors).The game is best known for the low quality of its localized voice track, a recurring theme with Telenet Japan CD games that saw US releases.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Forgotten Worlds is a  side-scrolling, 360-degree rotatable shooter that was released on multiple platforms in the late 1980s and early 90s. It features two floating soldiers sent to an alien planet to defeat a being known as  Bios. The game was originally known as Lost Worlds in Japan. It is also known for being the first Capcom Arcade game to use their CPS-1 board.Forgotten Worlds was originally released in the Arcades on July 1988. It would quickly be adapted for the home computer market, such as the Amiga, C64 and Atari ST, by US Gold. Other console versions would follow, including a Master System and Genesis version by Sega and a TurboGrafx-CD version by NEC Interchannel. It was recently rereleased on  Wii  Virtual Console in North America on November 17, 2009.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Fushigi no Umi no Nadia - The Secret of Blue Water</title_clean>
		<plot>Fushigi no Umi no Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water is one of the several games based on the anime series of the same name. The game assumes familiarity with the story of the anime, taking the player directly into the time frame of late episodes, where Grandis and the jewel thieves have already joined Jean and Nadia on their travels with Captain Nemo on his submarine "Nautilus". Following a dramatic scene that reveals more about Electra's past, the crew is stranded on a mysterious island. Jean, Nadia, Marie, and the lion cub King decide to explore it, and discover an ancient civilization in the process.The game plays mostly like an interactive comic book or a visual novel, though it does contain adventure elements such as verb commands. However, these commands are usually very sparse, and there are no sub-menus with objects or people to interact with. The game advances linearly, and the player's input is for the most part reduced to choosing between several locations to explore first. There is also a separate quiz mode where the player answers trivia questions asked by characters from the series.</plot>

		<plot>A side-scrolling "shoot-'em-up", Gate of Thunder asks players to take control of the space-craft "Hunting Dog". You fly left-to-right mostly, with occasional vertically-scrolling sections, and use several different weapon styles to defeat your many foes. Along with Esty in her ship the "Wild Cat", you must defeat the forces of General Don Jingi, who has plans of taking energy from the star of Aries.[CR]Playing as the pilot Hawk, players must avoid collisions and weapon-fire from the General's "Obellon" army. Consisting of many different types of enemy, the army has a massive, sprawling force of guns, turret, ships, battle-stations and mech-type units. Their fire-power is immense and you are the single opposing force![CR]Gate of Thunder allows players to choose in real-time from three weapon-fire types. A blue-coloured electrical fire, a green-coloured wave-fire, and a red-coloured quake-type fire. Along with this, players obtain homing-missiles and the assistance of the "Wild Cat" which orbits the ship separately. Gate of Thunder also features a critically acclaimed soundtrack that remains a talking-point to this day.</plot>

As such, it may reach very high prices on online auctions, often well over $400 for a mint copy. Counterfeit copies also appear in auctions, but it is possible to distinguish them from the legitimate product.[CR]This game was ported to PSP as part of the Galaxy Fraulein Collection compilation.</plot>

		<title_clean>Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Yuna 2 - Eien no Princess</title_clean>
		<plot>This is the second game in the  series about the school girl Yuna Kagurazaka, who fights crime in cosmic battles. Eien no Princess continues the story of the first game. Yuna has defeated the 13 Servants of Darkness, and their leader Lia has become a friend, fighting crime on her own in a superhero TV show. Life seems to continue normally, the only trouble being Erika, a snotty high school girl who sees herself as Yuna's biggest rival. She challenges Yuna to a fight, but both are spotted by the titular starship "Eternal Princess", commanded by the pretty Princess Mirage, whose task is to stop violence in the whole galaxy. What begins as a misunderstanding ends as a serious threat to the Earth...[CR]Eien no Princess is what is usually called a "visual novel". Most of the game consists of the player being taken to different locations automatically, where he watches the story unfold, accompanied by text and voice acting. Sometimes there is a menu verb to click on (such as "Look at..."), which doesn't mean much since the menu offers no choices. There are, however, a few turn-based battles in the game, with different attacks to choose, such as attack, defense, special, etc.</plot>

		<plot>This interpretation of the famous giant monster from the Japanese cinematic industry takes form of a fighting game, only instead of the usual brave martial artists the players control horrifying monsters from the traditional  Toho lineage: the titular beast itself, Rodan, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and others. The game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed the Normal mode.[CR]The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.[CR]The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal "punch-kick" scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood.</plot>

		<plot>The Demon God has abducted the princess Misa, intending to sacrifice her in order to restore his power. The king has sent an army to rescue his daughter, led by a knight who was carrying the legendary Sword of the Valiant. All the soldiers were killed by the minions of the Demon God, and only the brave knight survived. But as he delivered the fatal blow to the Demon God, he was himself mortally wounded by him. The princess Misa has no other choice but to take the Sword of the Valiant and to find a way to escape from the Demon God's dungeon, full of deadly traps and enemies...[CR]Gtzendiener (for some reason the title is German, meaning "idolator"), made by the creators of  Princess Maker, presents its own take on "rescue the princess" story: here, there is nobody who can rescue the princess but herself. Armed with the sword, the princess must explore the isometric dungeon, fighting enemies in real-time combat and solving environmental puzzles on the way. The princess jumps automatically, and the actions in the game are limited to attacking enemies with a sword and pushing and pulling objects.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Golden Axe is side-scrolling hack and slash game developed by Sega and released in 1989 as an arcade game. It was later ported to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, as well as a few other platforms including Xbox Live Arcade on July 11, 2007.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]An evil being known as Death Adder has taken over the once peaceful land called Yuria. Having murdered many innocent people, he also captured the king and his daughter. Death Adder's coup de gr&#226;ce was finding the magical emblem of the land, the Golden Axe. And unless the people of Yuria accept him as the land's new king, he promises to destroy it.Starting the game requires players to select one of three characters, each of which is filled with revenge. While all three share the same goal of saving the king and his daughter, and stopping Death Adder from destroying the Golden Axe, each one has individual ambitions as well.Gilius Thunderhead - a battleaxe-wielding dwarf whose twin brother was killed by Death Adder's henchmen. His heart is filled with hate for the evil being.Ax Battler - a barbarian who wields a two-handed broadsword, his desire to stop Death Adder fueled by the hatred he feels for him, because the evil being killed his mother.Tyris Flare - a longsword-wielding amazon, she wants revenge on Death Adder for the murder of both of her parents.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Story modeTo advance through the game, players must fight through swarms of Death Adder's henchmen, including mace-wielders, giants, and barbarians riding dragons and other mythical creatures. Killing a henchman mounted on one of these creatures affords players the opportunity to ride it as well.Players possess the ability to cast magic spells, which require magic potions obtained by kicking small, strange-looking thieves. More magic potions equal more devastating magical attacks. Picking up meat by kicking thieves helps recover lost health on the health bar.It is also possible to play through the game cooperatively with a second player.Duel modeDuel mode was implemented in many of the ports, but it was never included in the original arcade version. In Duel mode, players must fight through a number of small stages. Each stage has a handful of enemies to defeat. Defeat all the enemies to advance to the next stage.Duel mode can be played with two players, but it changes the goal entirely. The two players will have to fight each other to see who is crowned best warrior.[CR]Port Differences[CR]The Genesis is considered the most faithful port, visually and gameplay-wise. The DOS port for PCs is based directly on the Genesis port, and is almost as faithful in terms of aesthetics when playing in VGA mode.When the game was ported to the Genesis, Sega added one extra level that takes place right after the players defeat Death Adder. Where the arcade version ends right then and there, in the Genesis version, the large dungeon doors in the background of the level open and the characters walk inside. The final level takes place in this dungeon, after which the players face a new final boss called Death Bringer.As mentioned prior, Duel Mode was a new addition to the Genesis port of the game.In the Genesis port, when enemies are defeated, they flash and disappear as opposed to turning to stone.Some of the more graphics-intensive varieties of spell effects did not make it over to the home ports of the game. For instance, when Ax Battler is carrying his maximum capacity of potions, the spell he unleashes in the arcade version features a mushroom cloud emanating from the floor with huge rocks erupting towards the screen. In the DOS version, this high-level spell merely looks like a series of small eruptions scattered around the screen. The Genesis version aims to replicate the spell more effectively, but the rocks are smaller and they spit out to the side rather than scaling towards the screen.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Gambler Jiko Ch&#363;shinha: Mahjong Puzzle Collection is not a mahjong game; rather, as the title implies, it is a puzzle game that uses mahjong tiles. The player is presented with a board full of mahjong tiles; the goal is to match identically-looking tiles in pairs, causing them to disappear. Only tiles that have no obstacles (i.e. other tiles) on their path to each other can be matched. New tiles are added by the game on squares adjacent to the removed ones. The player must think ahead in order to complete the puzzle, avoiding unwinnable situations.There are nine different boards, with tiles placed in different patterns of varying difficulty. In addition, there are four difficulty levels, measured by the time limit allowed for each puzzle (the easiest level has no time limit at all). Characters from the Gambler Jiko Ch&#363;shinha manga can be asked for advice a limited number of times.</plot>

		<title_clean>Hataraku Shoujo - Tekipaki Working Love</title_clean>
		<plot>Tekipaki: Working Love is a simulation game somewhat similar to  Graduation series, but with a much less complex system and "working girls" instead of students. The game's graphics were drawn by the manga artist Izumi Takemoto. The setting is 23rd century, and the player has to take care of three girls from different planets: Naomi, Hikaru, and Edalt. The goal is to make the girls successfully perform their working duties (mostly secretary-like assignments), at the same time having free time to rest. With each activity, certain parameters (stamina, intelligence, etc.) of the girl will increase and decrease. Since the three girls have different parameters from the beginning, it is important to understand their personalities and to find the right balance between work and leisure. The girls also have a "loyalty" parameter, that usually increases when the player lets them have a day off.</plot>

		<title_clean>High Grenadier</title_clean>
		<plot>High Grenadier is a turn-based strategy game with role-playing elements. The game has a rather abstract plot that depicts a battle between two human organizations, each piloting and commanding giant mechs; no further details are revealed in the game. The gameplay takes place on a battlefield composed out of dots connected by lines; both player-controlled and opponent's army can move only between adjacent dots. The player has six commanders at his disposal; each of them can lead a several various mechas into the battle. Three commanders are available initially, while others can be called into battle later. Once a player-controlled and an enemy unit meet on the same dot, the player can order the commander to attack, defend, or retreat. The battle then proceeds automatically, its result calculated by the statistics of both units. The role-playing element involves leveling up mecha parts; a number of experience points is awarded after a battle, and the player can freely distribute them to raise the mecha's parameters.</plot>

		<title_clean>Himitsu no Hanazono</title_clean>
		<plot>A high-school student named K&#333;suke had a dream, in which he saw a beautiful woman talking to him. The next morning he found out that the new teacher looked very similar to the woman he saw. After overhearing a conversation, K&#333;suke realizes that the new teacher is in fact a detective sent to investigate the murder of a female student that occurred in the gym. The young man has to play his cards right in order to become part of the investigation, solve the mystery, and perhaps impress the attractive teacher in other ways.Himitsu no Hanazono is essentially a visual novel. There are no verb commands and no real interaction with the environment. The choices are rather frequent and fairly numerous (usually four or five choices at most screens). Most of these choices, however, do not affect the plot, though they may alter subsequent dialogue. The player is also able to navigate the protagonist on school grounds and inside the main building in a top-down fashion, visiting locations in any order.</plot>

		<plot>Hokutosei no Onna (the title refers to the express train connecting Tokyo and Hokkaido in Japan rather than the Ursa Major constellation) is based on the works of the Japanese detective story writer Ky&#333;tar&#333; Nishimura, starring Inspector Totsugawa and his assistant Kamei, who is the protagonist of the game. A man was found stabbed to death in his apartment in Tokyo; shortly after the investigation begins, another man is killed in a hotel room in Hokkaido. Kamei must question witnesses and suspects and examine evidence in order to solve the mystery.The gameplay format is that of a Japanese adventure: the player selects verb commands (Examine, Ask, Move, Show, etc.) and combines them with people or objects to gather information and advance the plot. At certain points the interaction switches to point-and-click interface, requiring the player to carefully examine a room or an object, searching for clues. </plot>

		<title_clean>Horror Story</title_clean>
		<plot>Originating on the arcades (where it was known as Demon's World to the Western audience), Horror Story is an "old-style" side-scrolling platformer/shooter. The basic gameplay premise is very simple: shoot and jump your way through large amounts of monsters, defeat the boss, proceed to the next level. There is no narrative of any kind in the game, and no cut scenes; the hero is a tough-looking  Duke Nukem-look-alike equipped with guns. [CR]The screen is scrolling at all times, even if the player character doesn't move. The levels are almost entirely linear, the only choice sometimes being to stay on the ground or jump to the higher platforms. Cooperative two-player mode is available.[CR]Though shooting is decidedly the main gameplay element here, jumping (particularly double-jumping) must be used liberally to navigate the hero through platform-based stages, and avoid and kill enemies (since jumping on their heads eliminates them as well). Weapons can be switched by catching power-ups, which appear as floating, constantly changing letters. Depending on the letter the player decides to take, the hero will get different weapons. These weapons include: a steady energy beam of moderate power; flamethrower; bombs; a short-distance grenade launcher of sorts; and a gun that spits fireballs in three different directions.[CR]As the name implies, the game has a horror theme. The game begins in what looks like old Japan, complete with traditional Japanese demons, but later switches to more "mainstream" horror, complete with haunted towns, ghosts, zombies, skeletons, etc.</plot>

		<plot>Power Golf 2: Golfer is a follow-up to Power Golf. The game attempts to realistically simulate golf and contains many features and variables that influence gameplay. There are two modes in the game: Normal and Tournament. In the normal mode up to four players can compete against each other or computer opponent in stroke play, match play, driving range, and putting green. Real Japanese golf courses are available for selection, complete with digitized photos and introductions. The player can select to control Japanese golfers and choose between a variety of clubs, as well as manually influence the shot, controlling force, angle, and the exact part of the ball the player wishes to strike.The Tournament mode is essentially a managerial simulation game. The player takes control of a golfer in an unnamed city. The goal is to accumulate enough currency and fame, as well as increase personal attributes of the golfer in order to participate in tournaments. Currency is obtained by doing part-time jobs, e.g. as a caddie in golf matches, or by gambling at slot machines. The player can also visits shops to purchase clubs and other golfing equipment. There is an in-game schedule that keeps track of tournaments and also incorporates random events (such as accidents). It is also possible to send the golfer on a vacation when he is too tired from working or practicing golf.</plot>

		<title_clean>Hyaku Monogatari - Honto ni Atta Kowai Hanashi</title_clean>
		<plot>Its sub-title translated as True Scary Stories, Hyaku Monogatari is a video game homage to the parlour game Hyaku Monogatari Kaidankai, which was popular during the Edo period (17th - middle of 19th century) in Japan. The game involved gathering at night, lighting a hundred candles and telling horror stories, extinguishing the candles one by one until the room became completely dark.The game contains a hundred horror stories told in a linear fashion through text, digitized photos and sound effects. Most of the stories are very short and non-interactive. The exceptions usually involve visual novel-like choices of locations or responses to situations, which sometimes affect the story's conclusion. A recurrent episode involves visiting various locations in Tokyo area and reviewing criminal cases and ghost stories.</plot>

		<plot>After humans ventured into outer space, they began building colonies there. It became increasingly hard to maintain them, and special robots known as "Bidroids" were invented to do the hard work. However, the colonies began waging war on each other, and Bidroids were used for military purposes. When peace was finally achieved, the leaders decided that Bidroids could continue functioning as combat machines, but in friendly championships rather than in deadly wars. Hyper Wars is primarily a managerial simulation; robot combat itself is calculated depending on how the player created and maintained his or her robots. The player controls a manager of a team which competes in a league, complete with schedules, stadiums, etc. The player is given an initial budget with which he or she is able to create the first robot models and train them. Each robot can be created by merging together various parts ("human", "beast", "bird", and so on). After creation, it is necessary to outfit the robot with weapons and upgrade its parameters by paying for training. When the player feels ready, the robots can be taken to combat arenas and participate in the tournament.</plot>

		<plot>IQ Panic is a quiz game with a background story. A demon has kidnapped a girl from a peaceful village, and the elders send a boy named Gengor&#333; to bring her back, defeating the demon's minions using his intelligence and knowledge. The game has a pseudo-RPG structure, with top-down navigation, overworld, towns, dungeons, treasure chests, random and boss "battles", etc. However, real RPG elements are very light in the game: there is no leveling up, and the protagonist's health increases automatically following a plot-dictated boss encounter.The core of the gameplay are the trivia "battles" against randomly appearing characters. Each "enemy" will ask the hero one question in a variety of topics (English language, geography, popular culture, etc.). Answering the question correctly within the time limit will "kill" the enemy, while giving a wrong answer will reduce the hero's HP by one point. Boss enemies offer a choice of topics and take several correct answers to defeat. A few items can be used to restore HP, reduce the time limit, return to a town, etc.</plot>

		<plot>Iga Ninden Gaiou is an action game by Nichibutsu where the player takes control of a Samurai/Ninja who must rescue his lovely girlfriend. The game takes place in Ancient Japan where sword fights meet mystical magic and demons... but not only as later stages even transport the player to futuristic worlds and cities. The main character uses his sword most of the time to defeat his enemies. But he can also charge up and throw knives. RUN can also launch a mystical attack. But use those wisely as they are only available in a limited quantities. As expected in this sort of game, a boss awaits for you at the end of each stage and unlocks new powers and weapons when defeated.</plot>

		<plot>Image Fight II Operation Deepstriker is a vertical shooter by Irem and sequel of the arcade game Image Fight originally released in 1988 (and ported to the PC Engine in 1990). Humanity tries to rebuild itself from the aftermath of the first Image Fight - the computer on the moon was destroyed and peace had finally returned. But three years after the attack, a space probe detects unknown objects hurtling towards planet Earth. The signs are clear - a massive alien invasion is underway. After a first encounter around Saturn, Image Fight requires the player to progress through four "simulation stages" - the last six "real stages" can only be accessed if the "simulation" achievement rating is greater enough. Failing this requirements leads to a short but intense Penalty Area. All the primary weapons from the original game are also here for the taking. Up to three colored orbs can be attached to the ship and either fire forwards (blue) or in the opposite way the ship is moving (Red). Secondary devices are also available and can be equipped at the front of the ship - they include all kind of lasers and missiles. However the only way to switch to a different device is to receive a direct hit.</plot>

		<title_clean>In Magical Adventure - Fray CD - Xak Gaiden</title_clean>
		<plot>This version of Fray in Magical Adventure differs from the  original MSX and subsequent computer releases in several ways. It retains the major events of the story and gameplay mechanics; even though it has more detailed graphics, it still looks too similarly to the original release to be qualified as a remake. The major difference is in the layout of locations and enemies. Some levels are entirely different, even when they are composed of the same elements. For example, the introductory level of the original version is skipped; the subsequent level has a different layout and new enemies. There are more treasure chests in this version's levels, more items, and more areas that require jumping. [CR]This version also has different cut-scenes (for example, the introduction describes some of the events during Fray's study years, which were absent in the original version). The conversations with other characters are longer; certain events are triggered in a different way (such as the necessity to first talk to the guard to trigger the conversation with the mayor in the first town). There is voice acting during important cut-scenes.</plot>

The protagonist is a high-school boy who first sees a mysterious girl in a dream, and is later very surprised to discover that this girl is his new classmate. Afterwards, the two become acquainted and embark on a series of adventures involving a time machine and a trip to feudal Japan.The game has cartoony, though not anime-like graphics; digitized photos of Mami Inoue are used throughout. Gameplay-wise, it is a simple Japanese-style adventure, with verb commands (Look, Talk, Move, etc.) and objects selected from a menu in order to advance the plot. </plot>

The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Yu's disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.[CR]Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.</plot>

		<plot>A direct sequel to Jantei Monogatari 2: Uch&#363; Tantei Divan - Shutsud&#333;-hen, the game continues the overarching plot, following the events of the previous game. The evil alien Dora and his sexy female demonic minions are descending on Earth, sending their subordinates to stop Divan and Marie. Divan must use his robot transformation abilities to defeat them, which can only be done when playing mahjong.The mahjong gameplay in this installment of the series is identical to that of its predecessor, including points distribution and execution of powerful transformation moves to gain the upper hand in the round. Unlike the previous games in the series, this chapter eschews the rudimentary adventure gameplay, featuring long non-interactive cutscenes between mahjong matches. Another change is the addition of a new mode that allows the player to compete against opponents from the story mode at any time, without going through the story.</plot>

		<plot>Uch&#363; Tantei Divan is a follow-up to Jantei Monogatari, though it can be hardly considered a true sequel because of its entirely new setting and themes. Set in a sci-fi environment, the game casts the player in the role of Divan, a young man who possesses the ability to transform into a powerful supernatural being, and is entrusted by military authorities to protect Earth against an alien demonic attack. This can be done only by defeating the evil minions in mahjong games.Though featuring elements of a Japanese-style adventure game (verb commands that must be selected from a menu to trigger the next scene), the game focuses on mahjong matches against opponents, which occur as dictated by the plot. The game uses standard mahjong rules, with the exception of bonus powers that can be acquired for points distributed after each round and used in subsequent matches.</plot>

		<title_clean>Jantei Monogatari 3 - Saver Angels</title_clean>
		<plot>The events of Saver Angels take place after those described in the previous installment of the series, when peace on Earth has already been restored thanks to the efforts of Divan and Marie. Three cosmic spirits have lost their way in space and have to descend onto Earth, taking corporeal form. They enter the bodies of three young women who died recently: one in a traffic accident, another from disease, and the third one - a ten-year-old girl - after committing suicide. All three were avid mahjong players, and all three are now revived and endowed with mysterious mahjong powers. A special Mahjong Academy opens, and the Saver Angels (as the group begins calling itself) is ready to defeat any aliens and demons in that ancient Chinese game.Saver Angels restores adventure elements that were absent from the previous game, and even enhances them. The player is now able to move in first-person perspective by pointing and clicking on a spot on the screen. Exploring locations, the player triggers scenes, which in turn lead to mahjong games. A special "mahjong mode" allows the player to choose an opponent from the story mode and challenge her (or him) to a mahjong match right away.</plot>

		<title_clean>KO Seiki Beast Sanjuushi - Gaia Fukkatsu Kanketsu-hen</title_clean>
		<plot>This release walks a fine line between an updated version and a full remake of  KO Seiki Beast Sanjushi: Gaia no Fukkatsu. The game follows the same story for the most part, and contains the cut scenes from the original version. Like most PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD games, it features voice acting during cut scenes and CD audio tracks.[CR]Several cut scenes were added, and some dialogues expanded. Though the story progression and the areas the characters have to traverse in order to advance it remain intact most of the time, the gameplay system has received an overhaul, being essentially developed from scratch. The "RPG-lite" feel of the original version is now somewhat compensated by the ability to equip weapons and armor, as in most RPGs. Combat engine has also been modified; instead of the isometric battle screens of the original, the battles are now viewed from "over-the-shoulder" third-person perspective, with player-controlled characters visibly attacking the foes, similarly to  Phantasy Star IV.</plot>

		<plot>The protagonist of the game was watching a performance by the Japanese singer Noriko Sakai (NORI-P) on TV. Suddenly, the singer was caught in a whirlwind and disappeared. The hero bravely followed her into a magical alternate dimension, but ended up in a forest, unable to find her. He must now find NORI-P and defeat an evil magician in the process.Kagami no Kuni no Legend is a Japanese-style first-person adventure game. The player interacts with the game world by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects or characters. Commands such as "Examine" or "Talk" appear at most screens; if an object can be taken, an appropriate command is displayed after the player has thoroughly examined a location. There is also an inventory with items that must be used at specific moments; however, there are no real puzzles in the game. Navigation is done by selecting the "Move" command; in a few locations the player navigates the hero with directional buttons in a pseudo-3D environment. Wrong choices may sometimes lead to a Game Over.Most of the background and character graphics is done in anime style, with the exception of Noriko herself, who appears in digital photos, sometimes accompanied by song performances.</plot>

		<title_clean>Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman 3 - Ikai no Princess</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman 3: Ikai no Princess ("Restructuring Superhuman Shubibinman: Princess of Another World"; Shubibinman is sometimes used instead of Shubibinman) is a PC Engine CD-ROM exclusive and the third game in the Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman series, the first two of which were released on the PC Engine HuCard format. The second game was also localized to the US TurboGrafx-CD as Shockman.The gameplay of the third Shubibinman game has more in common with the first game of the series than the second; the sword has returned as Tasuke and Kyapiko's basic weapon, and a more Shubibinman 1 style "shubibeam" is featured; it is now somewhat controllable after release, but this is also risky as the potentiality of getting hit his high. In addition Tasuke and Kyapiko are capable of wall-jumping, but this is relevant only at a few points in the game.ItemsContinue Chip: The player can collect 100 of these for an extra life, allowing them to continue mid-stage without having to restart!Hyper Chip: A chip that is flickering rapidly. Worth 5 capsules!Battery: Pick this up to restore a point of the player's life.Big battery: Completely restores the player's life.Light bulb: Completely restores the player's life AND adds an extra point of life to the life bar![CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Tasuke and Kyapiko are spending a nice relaxing day at the beach, when suddenly a huge spaceship appears overhead! This can only mean one thing... another invasion! Tasuke and Kyapiko suit up and set out to stop it... or is it all just a gross misunderstanding?Princess Cleha, Bacchi and Choppin: The goofy "antagonists" of the piece. In reality Princess Cleha is trying to get Shubibinman's help to avert an attack from the underworld, but her intense arrogance and sense of entitlement make her go about it in an extremely questionable manner.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Because of the game's almost continuous nature, some of these stage breakdowns are a bit arbitrary.Stage 1: In pursuit of the ship! Tasuke and Kyapiko give chase as the ship flies over the city. Soldiers and robots from the ship rain down to stand in their way. Eventually the team battle a robot called the "hojihoji"; upon defeat they can ride in it for a boost in their pursuit efforts.Stage 2: Mysterious Spaceship! Finally our heroes catch up and board the ship. The ship's defenses are out in full force, but our heroes easily battle their way to the engine room and destroy the power crystal. Upon doing so they are confronted by Bacchi, the first of Princess Cleha's two goons. He's actually a cyborg, just like our heroes!Stage 3: En route to the castle! After a rough escape from the space ship, our heroes touch down in a snowfield populated by snowmen controlled by robotic cores. They continue on through a mine an end up on the back of a train... however, THIS train generates shapeshifters, which turn in to copies of our heroes! The robotic conductor strongly disapproves of our heroes riding for free, but he puts up little resistance.Choppin is ready to fight!Stage 4: Arrival at Cleha's castle! Entering the castle, our heroes are swarmed by face-hugger like insects. Choppin appears near the beginning of the stage to attack our heroes, but after his defeat he makes a quick escape via rockets in his cape as lava begins to fill the shaft! Kyapiko and Tasuke must race to the top to avoid a fiery doom. Hordes of life-stealing ghosts await at the top of the shaft, and after them... Cleha herself!Stage 5: In a fury, Choppin opens the portal to the underworld and our heroes are hurled in! Unfortunately the demons of the underworld are well aware of this, and the unnamed demon Captain planning an attack our world deploys his "Dragon force" to take out Kyapiko and Tasuke! After a short welcoming to Hell via a trio of masks, our heroes must right strange larva-like creatures through a barrage of meteor-like objects... only to end up being pursued by a dragon!Spiders that shatter.Stage 6: Arrival at the demon Captain's castle! Of course it's heavily defended by demonic soldiers, including a giant knight and crystalline spider-women. The demon captain appears to make the Shubibinmen battle a large spider-demon as a mid-boss. As the heroes continue deeper in to his castle, the terrain becomes more grotesque; throbbing tissue grows beneath the ground and influences the movement of the castle's floors, and hungry insectoid mouths growing in the floors and ceilings are just itching to take a bite out of anything that strays too close. Waiting at the end is the demon captain himself, preparing a devastating weapon built from a Demon God's body!I'm a missile... AND a God!Final Boss: Stop the demon god missile before it reaches our reality! As it turns out, the whole adventure was a dream of Kyapiko's as she napped on the beach... or WAS it?[CR]</plot>

		<plot>You take control of a flying robot through seven massive stages. Fight against armies of flying insectoid enemies and other space ships and humanoid robots. The game designs are really similar to early Sunrise animations or Toei classic japanese series like Mazinga Z and Grandizer. Your robot can use different sort of weaponery, from standard blue spreading bullets, to green laser waves and even a sort of 'yoyo' attack. Stages have a standard structure with quite big end of level bosses. Your main weapon can also be charged and trigger a powerful and destructive attack. Use it to finish a boss and unfold a different inbetween level animation sequence !</plot>

		<title_clean>Kisou Louga</title_clean>
		<plot>An evil demon has emerged from the ruins of a sacred temple. A young woman named Erena is persecuted by the militant Hielun Empire, who pursues its own agenda and is convinced that Erena has a mysterious connection to the demon's powers. However, a knight named Vaice and his friends rescue Erena and prepare to defend her, gradually becoming involved in a large-scale armed conflict. Kis&#333; Louga is a turn-based strategy game. The gameplay consists entirely of battles, with anime-style cutscenes advancing the story between missions. The player navigates individual characters in an overhead locations. A contact with an enemy unit initiates a separate battle, where the player selects commands (Attack, Item, Special, etc.) from a menu. Castles play an important role during battles: characters can retreat and heal in a player-controlled castle, and conquering an enemy castle is often required as well as part of the mission's objective. Castles may be defended by arches, catapults, etc., and their gates must be destroyed by attacking them. Missions often involve battles between multiple sides. Despite the RPG-like menus, individual statistics, and equipment management, there are no real role-playing elements in the game, since characters do not level up or become stronger in another fashion.</plot>

		<title_clean>Kisou Louga II - The Ends of Shangrila</title_clean>
		<plot>The Ends of Shangrila is a direct sequel to Kis&#333; Louga. Vaice is on the way to his home country Distoria when he witnesses a group of bandits desecrating a temple. Shortly thereafter he encounters a young woman named Tifire, who describes herself as a fellow Guardian. Vaice and his friends soon draw the ire of a might empire and have to fight for their lives and the destiny of what they hold dear.The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, consisting of turn-based battles between Vaice's party and various enemy organizations. Role-playing elements have been enhanced, featuring an experience points system that makes character growth available. Like in the first game, contact with an enemy initiates a separate battle. These battles are more tactical in this installment, taking place on an isometric screen and allowing character movement.</plot>

		<title_clean>Kuusou Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy</title_clean>
		<plot>The game is set in our world, but with plenty of supernatural and comical elements added. Gulliver is a young boy who studies magic in a school in a small town in Italy, but is bored with the studies and craves adventure. After he gets his magical diploma, he goes to Venice to hook up with his best friends - the girl Misty, who has healing powers, and the genius inventor Edison. Together, they must stop the plot of the Spanish crown to dominate the world![CR]Kuso Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy, released originally on Turbo CD, is not the same game as the  SNES release, even though it is set in the same world and features the same heroes. Unlike the SNES game, which was an action RPG, this is a traditional Japanese-style turn-based RPG. It utilizes a fairly standard battle system with a four-heroes party, attacks and magic, etc. Stand-out features include a money system that is based on trading rather than obtaining gold from defeated foes, and the fact that the enemies are visible on the screen and the combat initiates once Gulliver comes into contact with them, rather than being random. [CR]The game features some full-motion anime-style movies (instead of comic-book-like cut scenes typical for Turbo CD games) and voice acting.</plot>

		<title_clean>Lady Phantom</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A turn based strategy game in the tradition of other console titles like Famicom Wars or Fire Emblem, Lady Phantom embraces the world of mech combat for it's setting. Although never released in the west, the basic gameplay of Lady Phantom is quite similar to the tabletop war games 'BattleTech' and 'Mekton' -including the use of hexagons for the gameboard rather than a traditional square grid.The game follows the exploits of a five woman mercenary team known as 'Lady Phantom'. As with other games developed by Telenet, each act (of which there are 10) is preceded by a fully voiced anime cutscene. Each character pilots a specific mech, and these are the only five units that the player has control over in each mission. However, before embarking on a mission, the player can select from a list of weapons for each mech to take into battle. Units destroyed in battle will return to full strength in the next, but miss out on the experience bonus at the end of a successful fight.Missions are typical of the genre; consisting of taking out all enemies on the screen, destroying a specific target, and escorting vehicles to a safe point. Enemies range from other mech units, to more conventional tanks and turrets, as well as spacecraft during space based encounters.As one would expect from the CD Rom format, the music does stand out, embracing a very contemporary sound (for the early 90s) in the vein of 808 State.Although never given a North American release, the game was given a page feature in GamePro magazine.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The primary game map is seen from an overhead view, overlaid with hexagons (which can be toggled off). The order that each unit gets to move and attack is determined by that unit's individual speed (rather than each side taking turns, as in Advance Wars). Combat takes place on a separate screen, where a graphic of the two involved units are displayed, and a brief animation plays out the results of the attack, in a manner very much like Fire Emblem. Units have facing (front, sides and rear), and weapons have optimal ranges based on their type. Units can also carry shields, which will take damage before the unit itself will. Turning a turn, a unit can move and then fire, fire and then move, fire or move alone, or remain inert.If all player units are destroyed, or all escort vehicles are destroyed, the mission is failed and must be restarted. The game automatically saves the players progress after each successful act.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Jennifer Sylkis - Pilots the PML-01F, is the leader of the team.Dora Langenkamp - Pilots the PMA-02ERamia O'Niel - Pilots the PMP-03SPCindy Matsunaga - Pilots the PMS-04C (a heavy weapons mech)Elene Myer - Pilots the PMX-05R, her character is something of the comic relief, though her mech is as capable as any of the others.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>1924, the town Newcam, Massachusetts. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. [CR]This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...[CR]"Devil of Laplace" is a hybrid between survival horror and traditional Japanese RPG, similar to the pioneer of this genre,  Sweet Home for NES. Unlike "Sweet Home", this game has less puzzles and is more oriented towards RPG elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</plot>

		<plot>The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.[CR]Last Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic  Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.[CR]Dungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.</plot>

		<plot>In Legend of Xanadu, the player controls a young adventurer named Areios. Monsters attack his homeland, and he is forced to flee. After traveling by ship and arriving at the town Bolda, Areios finds out that strange things have been happening in the North Cave near the town. His first mission will be to venture to the North Cave and investigate the matter. Of course, soon Areios finds himself involved in a battle against sinister forces, and commences the longest and most dangerous adventure of his life![CR]The game is an action RPG set in the Dragon Slayer universe, with a gameplay style similar to  Falcom's other popular series, Ys. Controlling Areios, the player explores the top-down world, visiting towns and fighting monsters in vast outdoor areas and dungeons. Like in Ys series, it is sufficient to "bump" into a monster in order to inflict damage. Areios gains hit points and becomes stronger by sustaining damage from enemies and resting. His weapons and armor can gain experience and level up. In many areas, companions will join Areios and help him in combat, controlled by the computer AI.[CR]The game is divided into chapters; the final stage of each chapter is a side-scrolling/platform level, which Areios has to navigate in order to reach the boss enemy, defeat him, and end the chapter. In such stages, the combat turns into a more familiar action-oriented style, with the player being required to press buttons in time in order to execute attacks and jump.[CR]There is a day/night cycle in the game, manifested not only in graphical changes, but also in the schedules of townspeople: when it's dark, people will return to their homes and go to sleep, etc.</plot>

		<plot>Falcom has pretty much established themselves as one of the finest RPG makers in the business, and Xanadu II - an offshoot of the Legend of Heroes series shows exactly why. The sequel to the first popular Xanadu game, Xanadu II is also an action RPG. This game retains the simple Ys inspired walk-into-the-enemy attack style which works very well and also the side-on action scenes used for boss battles. Being untranslated, the story is a little hard to plot out, but you play Arios and start out aboard a ship in search of your friend, whose own ship (as shown in the intro) was attacked by dragon riders. Eventually you get blown overboard in a vicious storm and end up on a beach near the city of Razan...</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In Loom, players take control of young  Bobbin Threadbare. Following cataclysmic events early in the game, Bobbin goes on a quest of fate and prophecy. Throughout the story, players interact with an enchanted swan with whom Bobbin is mysteriously connected.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The interface in Loom is unlike any of the other  SCUMM games; Bobbin interacts with his surroundings by using a musical distaff (a traditional weaving tool), which replace the standard adventure game commands. Musical phrases played on the distaff control Bobbin's surroundings in various ways. In the harder difficulty setting, the distaff's notation is removed, and the player must correctly select the correct area of the distaff to play specific notes, without assistance. The distaff can play a full 8 notes, from middle C to C. Four-note "Drafts", or musical phrases can be played backwards for the opposite affect, on occasion; ECED will open, DECE will close. While well received, the game didn't sell as well as Lucasfilms had hoped; a planned sequel never was created.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]If a player chooses expert mode (there are no markings or assistance in playing the distaff), Bobbin's hooded face is revealed at the games finale.Loom is referenced in a few other  LucasArts games, most notably  The Secret of Monkey Island. Examples include a minor Loom character appearing as the pirate in the  SCUMM bar who shamelessly advertises Loom, as well as  Guybrush's reaction to  Meathook. A dialogue selection from that event reads "I'm Bobbin, are you my mother?" Meathook replies, "Your mother was a duck." in reference to the swan from Loom. A seagull from Loom can also be found by the water outside the SCUMM Bar kitchen.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The original release of Loom came with an audio cassette containing a 30 minute dramatized prologue for the game.All the music in Loom is from the 1877 ballet "Swan Lake" by Tchaikovsky.[CR]Rerelease[CR]Loom was re-released on Steam on July 8th, 2009 along with a few other LucasArts classic adventure games.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Lords of Thunder</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title screen. Lords of Thunder (called Winds of Thunder in Japan) is a side scrolling shooter developed by RED and published by Hudson for the Turbo CD and Sega CD. Beyond its gameplay, the game is probably best known for its heavy metal soundtrack.  [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Landy versus Zaggart. Lords of Thunder's plot follows the attempted resurrection of an evil god named Deoric (Zaggart in the PC Engine version) by a force of six evil generals who serve the Dark Priest Zonbul of the Gald Kingdom. The player controls a brave knight by the name of Landy (a.k.a. Duran) who is granted a variety of magical armor by the goddess Farina. The generals have conquered the six kingdoms of Mistral to channel energy to the tower of Gald in order to revive Zaggart; Landy has to stop them all before it's too late![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The shop. Lords of Thunder's horizontal-scrolling shooting is augmented by a choice of four elemental armors and a shop that sells useful items before he enters the fray. Landy can also strike with his sword by moving close to the enemy and holding down the attack button; he continues to shoot as normal as well, and the sword strikes are quite powerful! Each armor also has a different effect when a "bomb" is used.Wind Armor: The wind armor fires moderately powerful shots straight forward; its power is simply increased as the weapon energy gauge is filled. The least useful armor. When a bomb is used in the wind armor, waves of lightning are emitted in both directions from Landy.Water Armor: Shoots waves of blue energy in addition to the basic shot. As this weapon is leveled up the energy waves become larger and more powerful; at max level waves are also fired backwards. The waves are strong and penetrate certain types of walls, making this a very easy to use armor. Perhaps tellingly, Landy is depicted as wearing this on the game's cover and in the game's cutscenes... When a bomb is used in the water armor, the screen is covered with spinning whirlpool like objects.Fire Armor: A basic armor with flame-based attacks. At max level the explosive fire shots evolve in to a powerful flame-thrower which is moderately controllable based on the player's movement. When a bomb is used in the fire armor a fiery salamander is summoned to destroy enemies.Earth Armor: The earth armor fires an extremely powerful "bomb" type-projectile towards the ground at an arc in front of Landy. When leveled half-way it also shoots one towards the ceiling; at max level they emit large shockwaves and are easily the most powerful attacks in the game. Get in close on bosses' weak points to kill them extremely fast! When a bomb is used in the earth armor meteors rain from the heavens.ItemsMost of these items can only be purchased at the store; however, crystals and a couple of other items are dropped by enemies, too!  A "fairystone" bomb.Crystals: The basic currency to be used at the shop, these are dropped by all sorts of enemies. Blue crystals are worth five and red are worth twenty-five.Lifestone: The variety dropped in stages, this restores three points of life to Landy. Quite rare!Magic stone: The variety dropped in stages, these increase Landy's weapon power. Blue ones add one point of weapon power and red ones add five.Lifestone (lv1): Only available at the shop, this adds two points of life to Landy's life meter.Lifestone (lv2): Only available at the shop, this adds five points of life to Landy's life meter.Lifestone (max): Only available at the shop, this completely fills Landy's life meter!Magic stone (lv1): Only available at the shop, this adds 3 to Landy's weapon meter.Magic stone (lv2): Only available at the shop, this adds 8 to Landy's weapon meter.Magic shield (lv1): A barrier that allows Landy to take a hit without taking damage.Magic shield (lv2): A slightly superior magic shield, this allows Landy to take two free hits.Magic shield (lv3): The best of the magic shields, this allows Landy to take three hits.Fairy stone: These are the "bombs" of the game, and their effect depends on the armor being worn when they are used. Up to three can be stored at one time.Elixir: This expensive item will completely restore Landy's life meter once when it has been fully depleted.Continue: Allows the player to continue if they get a game over![CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]The game's first six stages can be completed in any order.AuzalAuzal - the water stage: A watery area full of water dragons, jellyfish and winged soldiers. A strange monster is encountered as a mid-boss; a large portion of the stage takes place under water. Auzal is controlled by general Aspidd, who transforms in to a large half-snake beast headed demon for her duel with Landy.Dezant - the desert stage: This stage is filled with the basic magic flying soldiers who will trouble Landy throughout the game; half-way through the stage Landy descends in to a cave only to have to escape it in a high-speed sequence while avoiding the collapsing roof and enemies riding platforms covered with rotating blades. General Scorpion controls this area, transforming in to a large insectoid monster to fight Landy. Helado - the ice stage: With strong enemies and tricky obstacles this stage isn't to be taken lightly! Avoid getting blown around by the ice-faces in the cave and don't get crushed by falling icicles! This area is controlled by general Matansha, who transforms in to a kirin like beast.Cielom Cielom - the sky stage: Landy flies high in to the sky while battling rotating flame-spewing skulls and suicidal spearmen who leap from flying turtles and the windows of a huge flying cathedral. The cathedral proper is also defended by large iron golems. The boss is general Pajarona, second in command only to the dark priest Zonbul himself.Bosque - the forest stage: A creepy forest full of strange and dangerous wildlife, including man-eating plants, pulsing pods, and titanic insects. General Jardein is in command here; he transforms in to a massive creature which can fire a powerful stream of energy from its weak point.LlamaradaLlamarada - the volcano stage: The player must guide Landy up the outside of a volcano while avoiding fragments from an eruption and then down inside of the volcano to a fortress inside of it! Unsurprisingly this area is full of fiery enemies, including phoenixes and multi-headed firebreathing beasts. The intimidatingly named General Ballrender has mastery over the denizens here; he transforms in to a large demonic warrior with the power to seperate in to spheres. Zonbul's battle form. The seventh stage, the Dark Tower of Gald, is automatically entered after completing the first six stages. The first part is a typical stage where Landy advances up the tower to fight Zonbul at the end; the second segment involves Landy being granted infinite weapon energy by the Goddess Farina for the final duel with Zaggart.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Game disc.Like many disc-based games of the early 90s, Lords of Thunder takes advantage of the CD format with heavy metal instrumental music that goes far beyond hardware limitations of the era. The soundtrack was produced by Japanese music house T's Music.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Magical Dinosaur Tour is a purely educational resource for the TurboGrafx-CD console, and was one of the earliest games for the CD-based system to see a US release, and thus one of the earliest CD games. Rather than any traditional gameplay, the game features multiple statistics and information on a wide range of dinosaurs, as well as many general dinosaur facts. It has numerous clips of voice actors talking about dinosaurs and their diets, habitats and eras, and seems to be a "proof of concept" for the CD format not unlike the many similar educational games for the Phillips CD-i.The game saw releases in both the US and Japan. The Japanese version shortens the name to "Magical Saurs Tour".[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The boy Rhun and the girl Melvy live in a quiet forest village, both studying the art of magic. They enjoy a peaceful life, learning the secrets of the spirits and magical creatures populating the area. But on one fateful night, everything changes. A horde of goblins invades the village, burning it down. And it looks like the local church is in cohorts with a powerful demon bent on destruction! Before the heroes can realize what is happening, they are forced to escape into the forest, with only their magical powers at their side...[CR]Magicoal is a "pseudo-RPG", i.e. an action-adventure with some minor RPG elements (money, items, etc.), but without an experience system of any kind. It can be played in two-player cooperative mode, controlling Rhun and Melvy, or as a single-player game, choosing one of them and letting the computer AI control the other. The player(s) can switch between the two at any time.[CR]Most of the game is dedicated to exploring top-down areas populated by enemies, and dealing with them in action-based combat, primarily relying on magical spells. While some of the spells have unlimited use, others must be "refilled" with special items found or dropped by the enemies. Rhun and Melvy learn spells unique to each character, of various elemental affinities and general usage (offensive, support, etc.). Money can be collected from enemies as well and then used in shops to buy items.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shape Shifter is a fantasy side-scrolling action game from ICOM Simulations that is superficially similar to The Legendary Axe. The protagonist, the barbarian Lykos, travels the land to find the five rings of legend, once held by powerful forces of good, and uses the shapeshifter forms they provide him to fight the forces of the Dark Ones. The game is somewhat open-ended with multiple areas and a hub town with NPCs the player can visit and buy items from, similar to Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. Enemies drop currency which is needed for buying new weapons, healing or using the game's hint system.Shape Shifter was released exclusively for the TurboGrafx-CD in Japan and the US. It was published in Japan by Victor Entertainment and in the US by Turbo Technologies.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Martial Champion is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Konami for arcades on February 1993.The first fighting game by Konami after the success of Capcom's hit Street Fighter II, Martial Champion is known for its large character sprites (similar to the Art of Fighting series), bottom-positioned lifebars, limited weapon-based fighting, a final boss that attacks with the special moves of all other fighters, and a unique control scheme (featuring three attack buttons that correspond to the attack position, rather than attack strength, similar to their first overall fighting game, Yie Ar Kung-Fu).It was later ported to the PC Engine Super CD-ROM&#178; exclusively in Japan on December 17, 1993. This version was later digitally re-released for the Wii (via Virtual Console) in Japan on May 13, 2008.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Jin (Japan)Goldor (France)Bobby (U.S.A.)Racheal (U.S.A.)Chaos (Egypt, known in Japanese versions as Titi)Zen (Japan)Avu (Saudi Arabia)Hoi (China)Mahambah (Kenya)Titi (Hong Kong, known in Japanese versions as Chaos)Salamander (final boss, unplayable)[CR]</plot>

		<plot>In this game, the player controls a swordsman named Alan. One day he arrives at the village of Flodi, and finds out that his help is needed: the daughter of the village elder, Sophia, has been kidnapped by monsters and taken into the nearby cave. Naturally, rescuing Sophia is just the first quest among the many perils that await the hero on his journey...[CR]La Valeur is a RPG that mostly follows the Japanese format: the hero wanders through the top-down locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, gaining money and experience, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion. [CR]However, there are also some less traditional features in the game. There are three classes of weapons, distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies are strong/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them, and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.[CR]The entire quest is played solo, without party members. There is no "world map", which is characteristic for other games of this kind. The gameplay is heavy on "level-grinding"; typically, a certain level must be reach in a given area before the hero is able to defeat the boss enemy. After having reached this level, regular enemies of that area stop giving experience points.</plot>

		<title_clean>Master of Monsters</title_clean>
		<plot>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler  after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.</plot>

		<plot>It was just an ordinary cruise ship gig for the four musicians. The band leader, known only as the Flute (the player names him and the other heroes before the game begins), never thought that it will end in such a way... Suddenly, a tornado engulfed the ship, and the poor musician found himself in the magical world populated by angelic creatures and monsters! Naturally, this world, called Astralius by its inhabitants, needs salvation. Only the Magic Flute can avert a demonic threat. Apparently, our hero is the only flutist in all the dimensions, since it is now his task to take the unlikely role of a noble paladin, find other musicians to help him on his quest, and show everyone that music can, indeed, save the world![CR]Despite the somewhat unusual choice of protagonists, Mateki Densetsu Astralius is quite an "old-school" Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the nameless flutist and other musicians (trumpet player, drummer, etc.), who later join the party, exploring the top-down world, visiting towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, descending into dungeons, automatically leveling up, progressing the story in a linear fashion, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Casting magic spells is called "performing" in the game, though it requires magic points, like in other games of this kind. Those magic points must be bought in special shops.[CR]Unlike most other PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD RPGs, there are no voice overs or animated cut scenes in this game.</plot>

		<plot>In a magical country where only women dwell, young girls study in a magic school to become powerful and benevolent goddesses. One day, four magical orbs fell into the hands of a student named Rin-Rin. The clumsy girl managed to lose all of them, without understanding what this could lead to:  nobody knows what will happen if the orbs fall into wrong hands - those of the dark goddesses! Aided by a little fairy named Pop, Rin-Rin has to gather the legendary goddesses and to find a way to retrieve the orbs.[CR]Megami Tengoku is based on an anime of the same name (translated as Megami Paradise). It plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG with turn-based combat. Rin-Rin uses magical spells to fight enemies. An unusual feature of the game is the ability to change clothes, and the fact that every dress changes the graphical appearance of the character.</plot>

		<title_clean>Might and Magic</title_clean>
		<plot>This version of Might and Magic: Book I differs from all the others in several significant aspects.[CR]The most important difference is the player's inability to create his/her own party of adventurers. Instead, the player controls a party of six pre-set characters, which cannot be changed. These character have names, portraits, assigned character classes and even alignments; however, only one of them is given some story-related background, which is shown in the intro created specifically for this version.[CR]Supposedly the "main character" of the game, a paladin named Amuru, is traveling on a ship, when an evil centaur fires a magic bolt and destroys it. Amuru is saved by an elderly cleric; afterwards, the game switches into the familiar Might and Magic free-roaming exploration, with the main story taking a backseat, and the motivations of other characters that join the party unexplained.[CR]Many encounters and new quests were added to the game, presumably in an effort to make it more similar to Japanese RPGs; however, the main gameplay mechanics remain decidedly Western, with an open world free for exploration instead of emphasis on the story line. Basic combat mechanics remain the same, but many enemies are different; also, enemies might appear in very large groups, sometimes over ten at once.[CR]While the game still retains the graphically sparse, vast game world which is viewed entirely from first-person perspective, many areas are different, and all the character graphics - for heroes, enemies, NPCs, etc. - have been redone from scratch, having a much more distinct anime edge.</plot>

		<title_clean>Might and Magic III - Isles of Terra</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The third entry of the Might and Magic series follows the same formula that previous titles had, but in terms of its interface, would settle upon the visual formula that would accompany the remainder of the party based role-playing branch of the franchise. Players can continue to seek out out quests, fight terrible creatures, and explore another vast world laid at their feet.As with the first game, Isles of Terra continues the tradition of including a full color map of the world that the game was taking place on (in this case, the Isles of Terra).Aside from the enhancements made to the interface, a new "escape" option was created within the game called "Mr. Wizard". If the player finds themselves lost, they can call upon his services and be teleported to their hometown. The cost, however, is an experience level.The combat heavy nature of the series continues with this entry although there were many puzzles and secrets to be discovered within the game. Unlike Might and Magic II, Isles of Terra does not offer an option to import characters from its predecessor. Players either start with an all-new party or the pre-built one provided.Special sub-quests for character classes are also included in the game to enhance their abilities.As was often the case at this time with the PC related releases of the title (such as on MS-DOS or the Amiga), a number of items were included with the game to enhance its immersion:A journal written by one of the main NPCs, Corak the Mysterious, who describes the mythology of the world, how its races came to be, his own quest, and the origin of each class within the game.A Quick Reference card that describes the basic controls, interface, and listed spells.The map of the Isles of Terra.An adventurer's notepad.Two new classes also make their debut in this game: the Druid and the Ranger.The eight default PCs of Isles of Terra all made an appearance in a future Might and Magic game set in the same universe, in a sense concluding their story arc. They appear as high level "travelers" (having arrived from space) in the intro of Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor, and eventually become allies/enemies of the player's party.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story of Might and Magic is a mix of fantasy and sci-fi elements, something that players only discovered once they have fought their way to the end of the previous titles only to discover fantastically advanced super science behind the veil of their respective worlds. Isles of Terra is no different.At the end of Might and Magic II, the players discover that the world of CRON is actually a massive space-faring colonization vessel developed by powerful beings known only as the Ancients. Sheltem, however, refuses to allow the Ancients to populate CRON as intended, seeing them as inferiors, and decides to send it into the sun instead. Narrowly, the party from that game manages to save CRON although Sheltem escapes.In Isles of Terra, players must put together a party to stop Sheltem's plan before he completes his quest to destroy that world as well. In it, they discover that Terra was the place where the nacelles of CRON and VARN (the worlds of the two previous titles) were headed in order to colonize it. Following the notes of the mysterious Corak, they discover that the world of Terra is divided into many different islands, towns, and castles, each filled with their own quests. After many harrowing adventures through each one, they finally gain access to the mysterious pyramids that are dotting its surface and discover the true nature of Terra.Near the end, the party manage to get into the Central Control Center beneath the last pyramid and find that Corak and Sheltem are engaged in a duel to the death. Their arrival manages to distract Corak for a moment allowing Sheltem to slip away into a transport tube. Following Corak's lead, the party discover more of the truth behind the Isles.Apparently, they were considered "The Grand Experiment" of the Ancients in "using the technology of Elemental Manipulation to create a completely viable ecological and social microcosm. This microcosm was then to be transported to a distant biosphere (Terra) to supplant it's indigneous ecosystem.". The game goes on to describe that the experiment needed a central control capable of handling unexpected anomalies.It is then that the party discover the truth behind Sheltem: he was created by the Ancients to be the Overlord and Guardian of Terra but his conditioning was critically flawed. He did see himself as the Guardian of Terra, but not of the colonization experiment initiated by the Ancients. As a result, he rebelled against the "army" that "invaded" his world who were actually the colonists. The Ancients managed to contain him, but he had escaped and was determined to undermine the Grand Experiment.From Sheltem's failure, the Ancients used these lessons to create Corak, a new Guardian. With his conditioning, the Great Experiment was successfully launched on its journey through the Void. Corak was to stop Sheltem and then oversee the colonization of Terra as its Guardian and Overlord.Sheltem, however, did not see his inability to stop Terra's colonization as a detriment. Instead, he found an opportunity and succeeded in disturbing the balance between the three alignments of men, a balance that Corak must now repair upon his return. However, his plan against Terra only gave him a small sense of satisfaction as he quickly sought to sabotage the other experiments that the Ancients had scattered throughout the Void.Both Sheltem and Corak have escaped through transport tubes but a third has been prepared for the party to pursue the two to the next world where Sheltem intends to continue his mad quest.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is centered around a six person party with the world seen from a first person perspective utilizing rudimentary 3D graphics for the outdoor locations and indoor dungeons. Monsters along with certain other encounters are displayed as 2D pictures. As was the norm at the time for several RPG titles, movement is centered around a grid based scheme which meant 90 degree turns and square-based movement forward or back.The game is also considered quite detailed as well as difficult. Players are required to maintain a stock of food in order to be able to rest outside of an inn to regain hit and spell points. Bashing open locked doors often set off traps if they are not disarmed. Leveling is not automatic.Once a character has earned the requisite experience, it must be spent at a training ground in order to improve their statistics and abilities. Gems are often required to cast higher level spells and characters can also die from old age (natural or not), although the proper spells could alleviate its effects. Characters can also be afflicted with a number of debilitating conditions which often prove incredibly fatal to starting parties. Sex and alignment can also restrict certain characters from entering specific areas or in equipping certain items.Isles of Terra also allows the player to save anywhere they wish outside of an inn.Towns and dungeons are no longer limited by the 16x16 grid although continue to use a grid-based movement system with 90 degree turns. Several other enhancements were also made:Searching is no longer required to find loot following combatVisible enemy encounters give players a chance to avoid unwanted battles or use ranged attacksImproved graphics based on VGA displaysSynthesized speechThe mouse was integrated into the controls (on PCs)Automapping was now providedRacesThe manual of the game took the form of a journal describing the world, its classes, and its races through a fictional story told from the point of view of one of the title's main NPCs, Corak.The game allows the player to select among five different races in building their characters. As with most other RPGs, certain races have slightly better statistics in certain areas and others, but the emphasis appears to be more on how resistant each one is against certain conditions such as falling prey to sleep spells or being more resistant to poison.The five races are:Human - Strong resistance to fear and some resistance to sleep spells. Average statistics make this race a good choice without any glaring weaknesses.Elf - They have a strong resistance to fear and are generally excellent at spellcasting.Dwarf - Some resistance to poison, stronger and hardier than the other races. They make excellent fighters but poor spellcasters.Gnome - Nimble and quick, they can make great paladins and decent spellcasters.Half-Orc - They have a moderate resistance to sleep spells, are decently strong, and can make great fighters.StatisticsThe maximum value for any one statistic is 18, although this can change depending on several factors based on spells or the effects of certain items. However, if any statistic drops to 0, it will result in immediate death for that character.The basic statistics used in the game seem derived from the Dungeons and Dragons model of statistics, although carry different names so as to differentiate themselves. They are:Intellect - General knowledge. Important to sorcerers as it can affect spell points. Important to archers later on at higher levels as they begin learning sorcerer spells.Might - Raw strength. Important to any fighting class such as Knights and Paladins. Affects the damage a character can inflict in melee combat.Personality - A character's general degree of appeal to others. Particularly important to clerics as it affects their pool of spell points. Important to paladins when, at higher levels, they begin learning cleric spells.Endurance - Stamina. Affects how many hit points a character initially has to start with and will gain every time they level. Particularly important to fighters.Speed - Agility and general quickness affecting initiative. A faster character improves (increases) their Armor Class rating making them harder to hit.Accuracy - A character's ability to land hits during combat. This is particularly important to archers.Luck - Measures the general chances of a character succeeding when all else seems to have failed. Random and unpredictable.ClassesSeveral classes are available for players to choose from in building their party of adventurers.Knight - These are considered the warriors of the game in being able to use any item or armor aside from those exclusively designed for another class or have an opposite alignment. They are able to attack more than once every round at higher levels.Paladin - While not quite as good as a Knight in combat, they are able to wield and equip as many items as they can with the same restrictions. At higher levels, they are also able to cast Clerical spells.Archer - These are the missile experts of the party and are able to use any weapon. Unlike the Paladin, they are also able to use missile weapons even in hand-to-hand combat. At higher levels, they are also able to cast Sorceror spells. They are restricted in the kind of armor that they can wear, however, such as chain mail or any lighter armor being the only types available for them and they cannot use a shield.Cleric - The traditional healer class, they can only wear light armor but they can also carry a shield. Weapons are restricted to a club, mace, flail, a staff, or a hammer. They cannot use ranged weapons such as bows. At higher levels, their healing abilities come in extremely valuable much further into the game. They are also the travel experts of Varn with spells that can teleport a party out from a dungeon, to a town for a quick rest, or enable them to walk on water to reach special areas.Sorceror - They can only wear padded armor and their choice of weapons are extremely limited and it almost goes without saying that they can't carry a shield. However, their spells more than make up this lack of physical protection and offensive ability with some of the most devastating attacks in the game.Barbarian - This character can use most weapons and starts with the greatest number of hit points out of any other class. A true tank character.Robber - The traditional thief of the game, what they lack in offensive and defensive ability are made up with their talent for disarming traps and locks. They can fight as well as a cleric, but are far better at keeping the party safe from poison gas or fireballs erupting from chests.Ninja - This character acts much like a fighting Robber, but they cannot carry a shield. They can use most one handed weapons but only swords specific to their class. Two handed weapons are limited to staves and the naginata. However, they do have the "assassinate" ability which is automatically attempted with their first attack. If successful, additional damage will result.Ranger - Can use most weapons and armor along with being able to cast clerical or sorcerous spells to a certain extent.Druid - As with the Sorceror, they are poor fighters. They can only use light armor and weapons but are able to cast Sorceror and Cleric spells, although not to the same extent as those dedicated to such disciplines. They also start with twice as many spell points as Rangers do.Character StatusIn addition to their class and race, characters have a number of other statistics that players will need to keep track of during the game.Level - This is a measure of how experienced a character is. Characters start out at level 1 and can only gain levels once enough experience is earned and the necessary training is purchased.Spell Points - A measure of how many points are available to any one character for use with spells. Certain spells have higher point requirements than others.Hit Points - The number of hit points a character has remaining. At zero hit points, a character does not necessarily die. Instead, they fall unconscious. However, if they suffer anymore damage after reaching zero, death is the only result.Armor Class - The higher this number, the more resistant a character is to damage. Armor, spells, shields, and speed are among the factors that can help determine it.Age - Characters start at 18 years of age and grow older as the game continues on. As they become older, their skills begin to deteriorate and vital statistics will begin to drop. After around an age of 80, the character can actually die from resting overnight. Age can be delayed or reversed using spells or in discovering special locations.Experience Points - These are earned from defeating monsters and quests. These determine whether a character is ready to advance to the next level through training. The point requirements for reaching the next level usually double.Gems - This measures the number of gems that a character is carrying. Gems are valuable as they are consumed in order to cast many higher level spells.Gold - The coin of the realm earned in a variety of ways whether it is from monsters or in discovering long lost treasures.Food - Characters start with ten food units (up to a maximum of 40). One food unit represents a day's rations and is consumed when camping to replenish hit points and spell points during rest.Condition - A character's current status, whether they are asleep, poisoned, dead, etc..Each character also has their own backpack which can carry a maximum of six items.AlignmentThere are no absolutes in Might &amp; Magic nor does this affect the story progression of the game. Instead, it largely determines certain restrictions such as whether a piece of equipment can be used or whether a particular character can enter specific areas.LocationsSeveral towns are scattered throughout the land offering valuable services and even a few side-quests. Due to the open ended nature of the game, the player was not implicitly told where to go, leaving it to their own inquisitive nature to discover where they should head off to next and who to speak to in order to find the next quest. In addition to the towns, many dungeons and secret locations are also scattered throughout the world.Towns share many of the same services.Shops - Where supplies, such as new armor and food, can be purchased.Temples - Where sick or injured characters can be healed.Training Grounds - Important for advancing character levels once enough experience has been earned.Taverns - Buy food, hear tips, create characters, and manage parties hereBlacksmith - Buy and sell weapons and other items, identify the unidentifiable, and fix what is broken because weapons and armor can break.Guild - Where new spells can be learned once one is at a sufficiently high enough level[CR]Combat[CR]Isles of Terra marks a pivotal change to the combat system of Might and Magic, one that would persist throughout the following chapters of the main series. Options that the first two games allowed the player to use in combat situations, such as bribing encounters to leave them alone or even surrendering, are no longer available.Enemies are visible allowing the player to attack them at a distance with ranged attacks (such as with bows) or take steps to avoid the confrontation entirely. By using hotkeys or the mouse, the player can easily manage the flow of combat with their favored peripheral.Once the enemy makes 'contact' with the party by closing the distance to melee, the player has to use one of the button commands on the interface to actually 'Run' from combat. By running from combat, the party ends up somewhere on the map near to where they had fled.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Minesweeper</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Minesweeper is a game included in all iterations of Windows from Windows 3.1 onward. The game consists of squares arranged in a rectangular grid. Some of the squares have mines hidden under them. If you left-click on a square with a mine under it then you lose. If there isn't a mine, then a number appears indicating the number of mines under adjacent squares. If there are no mines in any of the nearby squares, then it automatically clears those squares. The object of the game is to clear every square that doesn't have a mine. To make this easier, you can mark squares that you believe to have a mine with a flag. Also, some versions of the game allow you to place a question mark as an option. The game tells you the number of mines left that you have not marked. Also, the game clock records the speed with which you have completed the game. If you complete the game in a record amount of time for a given difficulty, then it saves your time and alias.The game includes three standard difficulty modes and a custom difficulty. The difference between the different modes is the size of the rectangular grid and the number of mines. The custom difficulty mode in the Vista version lets you set the height, width, and number of mines independently. The standard difficulty modes areBeginner: 9x9 grid, 10 minesIntermediate: 16x16 grid, 40 minesExpert: 16x30 grid, 99 minesUsing the Custom Mode, you can make the mine count as high as 667 with a 24x30 grid on Windows XP and Windows Vista.Using logic, it is possible to improve your odds of winning, but in some situations it is just luck. Maximizing your odds of succeeding is actually very difficult since it requires probability analysis. It is not enough to calculate the odds of a particular square having a mine. Rather, you must also consider the information revealed if there is no mine.[CR]Windows 8[CR]Minesweeper will receive a graphical update with the release of Microsoft Windows 8 in October. It's currently not clear what other new features it will release with (if any), but screenshots indicate, at least, a revamp visually.[CR]Records[CR]Many people have scored 1 second on beginner, which is the minimum score possible.The record time for intermediate difficulty is 7.27 seconds, set by Kamil Muranski of Poland. VideoThe record time for expert difficulty is 31.133 seconds, also set by Kamil Muranski of Poland. Video[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Mitsubachi Gakuen</title_clean>
		<plot>Mitsubachi Gakuen is an adventure game in which the player takes the role of a teacher in the Mitsubachi Academy, entrusted with the task of helping its female students to reach stardom by monitoring their studies and activities. The game is divided into four seasons, each with a sub-plot of its own (e.g. preparing to a competition with another school and handling intrusive journalists and possible spies), and each dealing with a team of five different girls. The player can check the dossier of all the twenty students at any time and learn more about them. The game features digitized photos of real people instead of the more common anime-style character graphics.Gameplay-wise, the game features a traditional menu containing verb commands for examining the environment, talking to characters, checking the inventory, moving to another location, etc.; most of these verbs lead to a list of possible objects to interact with. There are no puzzles, but a few instances require the player to make the right choices in order to continue the game; in other cases it is possible to slightly branch the plot by making a decision.</plot>

		<plot>Hiwako, the daughter of a convenience store owner in a little Japanese town, is just an ordinary Japanese teenager - actually a bit of a spoiled brat. Or so she thought, until one day, a talking bird named Nike (like the Greek goddess of victory, not like the footwear brand) told her that she possessed unique powers that made her transform into the glorious lady warrior Artemis. No, Hiwako didn't stop being a spoiled brat; but as Artemis, it is now her duty to protect her home town from a demonic invasion, and she does not intend to give up.[CR]Moonlight Lady can be called a "pseudo-RPG"; its top-down view and town exploration make it look like a representative of the Japanese branch of this genre, but in reality, it is an action game with strong adventure elements and no true role-playing system. [CR]Throughout most of the game, the player controls Artemis and two other heroines (Aquarius and Minerva). Attacking is performed by pressing a button for the lead character's attack, and another for a simultaneous attack by the two other girls. The player can switch the leader at any time. The girls can also charge their attacks to execute more powerful ones.[CR]Regular enemies populate the dungeons, but there is no reward (in the role-playing sense of this word) in defeating them; in fact, the player can try to avoid them altogether and head straight to the boss battle.[CR]A few items can be found and used throughout the game, but there is no real weapon and armor management, nor a financial system of any kind.</plot>

		<plot>You control a cute little duck walking around a maze, collecting eggs and powerups. When your eggs hatch, they head for your home, and bring you points (sometimes bonus points too). Of course, you can always disrupt the efforts of the other players, and there are other perils in the game. So, the object of the game is basically to hatch the most eggs &amp; get the chicks to your home before anyone else... There are 3 worlds, each containing 10 levels which are all selectable at anytime... The game follows much the same look &amp; feel as the Bomberman series, similarly, it allows up to 4 simultaneous players for multi-barrels of fun.</plot>

		<plot>Nexzr is a vertical shooter by Naxat Soft. In 2012, Earth is once again under attack and a large armada of enemy ships approaches our blue world. The player pilots the Slasher, a powerful space fighter, and prepares to face the oncoming threat. The introduction story is told through a series of fully animated cutscenes and reveals the intricate plot of the game. We learn that stopping the invasion is not our pilot's only goal - he is also on a quest of revenge after a fatal encounter with a large red mecha and the terrible loss, in front of his very eyes, of a close friend and fellow female pilot. He makes his way towards the enemy lines on his own, ready to launch a deadly ambush attack. The Slasher starts its mission with a standard Vulcan gun ("Rapid Shot/Wide Shot") and more weapons are available along the way such as homing flame-lasers ("Guided Fire"), side missiles ("Crawl Missile"), lasers, shields and secondary flying pods ("Funnel"). Unlike most of its peers, Nexzr is as bare as it gets on the weapon/power-up side. It features only one fire button and weapons have a single power level and can't be powered-up, without forgetting the total lack of smart bombs. Interestingly, the option menu offers a special arcade mode that shrinks the screen horizontally and offers a narrower field of view.</plot>

		<plot>Nemurenu Yoru no Chiisana O-Hanashi ("Little Stories for Sleepless Nights") is a cartoon-like adventure game designed for children and based on an original video animation by Y&#363;ko Hara. The protagonist is a cat named Neko-kun (which translates simply to "Cat"), who lives on a beautiful island together with his animal and human friends. The opening episode describes his encounter with a little star that fell on the Earth and injured itself. Afterwards, the player can explore the island by selecting locations on the map. Much of the story is advanced automatically, and the interaction is mostly restricted to choosing a location to visit, clicking on objects to trigger scenes, or selecting a "yes" or "no" response to a situation.</plot>

		<title_clean>No-Ri-Ko</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]No-Ri-Ko was one of the two launch titles for the PC Engine CD-ROM (TurboGrafx-CD) for Japan in 1988, the other being Fighting Street (a port of 1987 arcade game Street Fighter).The subject of this game is Noriko Ogawa, a teenage J-Pop idol who debuted in 1987. When the player finds Noriko's lost train pass, her manager arranges a date between the two of them. The player is then given the choice of where to go on the date.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays like a basic dating sim or adventure game. The player, who can write in their own name at the beginning, chooses what places to visit for the date, including a clothing store where an outfit can be chosen for Noriko. The player can also take some pictures of her and listen to several songs. The game also features several mini-games, including a game of rock-paper-scissors. A single playthrough takes roughly half an hour. There are several alternate paths and endings.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]While the gameplay is very limited, No-Ri-Ko is most notable in Japan for being the first technical showcase for the CD-ROM format in gaming (or at least to a much greater extent than Fighting Street). For the first time in a home video game, all of the dialogues in the game are voiced, with each line stored as an individual Red Book audio track on the CD; fully-voiced dialogues were previously only possible in laserdisc arcade games (i.e. interactive movies). It was also the first home video game to use digitized sprites.In addition to various chiptune tracks of Noriko's music, three of her singles are included as full CD tracks in the game with an accompanied music video cutscenes, each shown as a series of animations; this was the first time that a video game synced CD audio with in-game graphics and cutscenes. After completing the game, Noriko in the game attempts to speak out the name the player wrote at the start, years before Tokimeki Memorial used the same idea. No-Ri-Ko more or less paved the way for later PC Engine dating sims such as Tokimeki Memorial, which would took the Japanese gaming and anime industries by storm in the 1990s.[CR]External links[CR][I &#9829; The PC Engine] No-Ri-Ko [CR]</plot>

		<plot>Pachio-kun: Maboroshi no Densetsu is a pachinko game starring the semi-anthropomorphic character Pachio-kun. The goal of the game is to win as many jewels as possible by collecting points in pachinko games. The player has a limited control over Pachio-kun in top-down casinos, where the game can be saved, points exchanged for jewels, and all the pachinko machines accessed. The machines are presented in first-person view and come in varied flavors and designs, with different backgrounds, themes, and contraptions. Playing the machines involves adjusting the strength of the shot and then pressing the action button to release the balls. The player can also opt to view each detail of the machine on a zoomed-in screen. The game comes with a special controller that resembles a real pachinko joystick.</plot>

		<plot>Long time ago, an evil cosmic entity known as Geios was defeated and sealed for aeons. However, a malevolent alien race has found a way to harvest its power and is now preparing for its reincarnation. Pachinko Planet was attacked, and its king slain. Returning from an interstellar travel, Pachio-kun boards the spacecraft Sledgehammer and embarks on a journey to defeat evil and restore his homeland.Pachio-kun: Warau Uch&#363; is a pachinko game with a storyline and limited top-down exploration. In most areas, Pachio-kun has to complete one or more pachinko games in order to be able to leave the location and advance the plot. Pachinko machines come in different flavors and difficulty levels. The controls are fairly simple, requiring the player to adjust the strength of the shot; the shots themselves can be fired automatically. The game was shipped with a special controller similar to a real pachinko device.</plot>

		<plot>As its tile implies, Pachio-kun 3: Pachisuro &amp; Pachinko is a pachinko game starring Pachio-kun, an anthropomorphic pachinko ball who enjoys a peaceful life with his family on the Pachinko Planet. The game's plot is rather abstract and serves to tie together various time periods to which the hero travels after completing pachinko-playing sections. In each area there are casinos with pachinko machines. The player can talk to characters in the casino, exchange money for chips and vice versa, and play pachinko on variously themed machines. New areas become accessible after the player has won a sufficient amount of money in the previous casino.</plot>

		<title_clean>Palladion - Auto Crusher Palladium</title_clean>
		<plot>Auto Crusher Palladium is a game that simulates construction of battle robots ("mechs"). The player is able to construct robots using various parts: body, limbs, computer AI, weapons, etc. The result can be a combination of any forms and components, with the limitation being the overall weight of the robot, which must not exceed a specified amount. Robots can be humanoid, machine-like, rolling on wheels, able to fly or transform into different forms, etc.[CR]After a robot has been created, the player sends it to fight other robots. The battles look like those of a fighting game, with side-scrolling view and HP bars; however, they are non-interactive. The entire gameplay focus in on creating a robot in such a way that it would be able to defeat a particular enemy; the battles themselves allow no control from the side of the player.[CR]A "league mode" is also available, where the player(s) choose various models of robots and have them compete against each other in a tournament.</plot>

		<plot>Y&#363; is a young apprentice magician who lives in the Fairy World. One day, a magical error occurs, and Y&#363; finds herself on Earth. In order to return to her world, the little fairy must find three stones that must be inserted into her magical brooch. A young girl who finds the first stone becomes Y&#363;'s companion (and the game's protagonist), and together they must find and recover the other stones.Pastel Lime is a Japanese-style adventure with simple gameplay. Only a few commands (sometimes just one) usually appear on the screen, and the player's input is mostly reduced to selecting these commands several times to trigger the next scene. Sub-menus (such as conversation topics) may appear as well. Game progression is strictly linear, and the player has no choice of selecting locations to travel to.</plot>

The game also contains a variety of features (robot database, interviews with voice actors, etc.) accessible from the main menu, as well as a rock-paper-scissors mini-game starring various Labors.</plot>

		<title_clean>Prince of Persia</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia 1989Prince of Persia was originally released in 1989 for the  Apple II by  Jordan Mechner. Mechner used film of his younger brother David running, jumping, and performing many of the Prince's actions. Mechner then  rotoscoped the film to create the animations that give the  Prince his fluid movement.Part of the game's appeal was its then unique focus on  environmental puzzle-solving, as well as its one-on-one  sword duels. Mechner has stated that the game was inspired by the first ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the character's  acrobatics in a  dangerous environment.Prince of Persia has since been ported to a number of different platforms, including the  Amiga,  Apple Macintosh, DOS,  NES,  Game Boy,  Sega Genesis,  Game Gear,  SNES,  Sharp X68000,  Atari ST, and SAM Coup&#233;.The music was written by Jordan Mechner's father,  Francis Mechner.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia is a platformer with heavy emphasis on careful jumping and environmental puzzle solving. The player controls the Prince as he attempts to  rescue his princess before she  weds  Jaffar, the evil Grand Vizier. Jaffar has trapped the  Princess, and given her an hour to decide whether she wishes to marry him or die. This hour unfolds in  real time, and the only way to lose the game is to fail to reach the Princess within sixty minutes.The player is given only an hour to navigate the game's thirteen levels and rescue her. Scattered throughout each level are hidden  switches, secret  pitfalls and a variety of other hazards standing in the Prince's way of rescuing his beloved. There are also hidden  potions that have a variety of effects on the Prince.The player will have to explore and pay attention to their environment in order to solve the puzzles and make it to the end. The Prince will also have to fight his way past  guards to reach the Princess. Combat exists as a series of sword fights, which were unusual for its time when  projectile weapons were the norm.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Sultan of Persia, one day, leaves to wage war in a foreign land. His Grand Vizier, Jaffar, steps in to take his  throne while he is away. Shortly thereafter, a street urchin decides to climb the Royal Tower to see the Princess, whom people have claimed to be as beautiful as a new moon. When the young  orphan finally sees the Princess,  they fall in love. The couple intend to marry.The Vizier discovers this and decides that he wants to marry the Princess. He throws the street urchin into the lowest  dungeon and locks the Princess in the highest tower. He then gives the Princess one hour, counted on a magical  hourglass, in which she has to decide to marry the Vizier or die.The street urchin's main goal is to defeat Jaffar and reach the Princess.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The SNES versionAside from being ported to several different platforms, Prince of Persia has received  two  proper  sequels and a  3D remake.  Ubisoft re-imagined the series with its  Sands of Time  trilogy, and the French publisher again rebooted the series with a new game, titled simply  Prince of Persia. A motion picture based on  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is also being developed, Mike Newell directing, and is being produced by  Jerry Bruckheimer. The movie was released in 2010 starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, and  Ben Kingsley and was received with average reviews.The game was  ported many times, and version such as the  SNES one which improved on the original. In the SNES game, the graphics were updated, and the game was given 20 levels, and an extra hour to complete the game.The original Prince of Persia has sold over 2 million copies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 8,8,7,5 adding, "...very impressed with this version of the game. Not only were all the characters and pitfalls very easy to see on the small screen, but even the very fluid animation found on the other versions of the game was duplicated almost perfectly".[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Princess Maker 2 is the second entry in a series of child-raising simulation games developed by Gainax where the player must raise a young girl to become the princess of a fantasy kingdom. Gainax originally published the game on the PC-98 on June 15, 1993 and has since ported the title to a number of different platforms. A remake of Princess Maker 2 for Windows was created by GeneX in 2004 called the "Refined Edition" which featured redrawn artwork and new voice acting.SoftEgg Enterprises, along with shareware company Adventions, announced in the mid-1990s that they would be publishing Princess Maker 2 in North America for DOS computers. A full localization of the game was completed but, after being caught up in licensing hell, the English version was never officially released, although a beta copy of SoftEgg's translation was eventually leaked onto the internet. However in 2016, the Refine Edition of Princess Maker 2 was released in English on Steam by CFK, marking the first time a game from the series was official released in English. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Assigning a schedule.The player has eight years to raise the princess in ways they see fit. What kind of person they will turn out to be is dependent on the princess' stats and actions of the player. The princess has a long list of stats that are affected by the work or education she participates in. The princess also has stats of her weight and form. At the beginning of each month, the player can take the princess to various establishments such as restaurants that can affect the princess' weight or churches and can lower the princess' sin as well as the typical armory or tailor that make various costumes for the princess to wear. The player must also assign a schedule of three tasks for the princess. These involve working, going to school, setting out on an adventure or taking time off. Working and attending school puts stress on the princess. If put under too much stress, they will grow ill which can put them out of activities for a whole month while they recover. Lowing stress is achieved by giving time off, giving presents or taking the princess to restaurants. The game reportedly has up to 76 different endings, which are obtained by raising your daughter differently. Your daughter does have some predispositions, determined by her birthdate and blood type, for example, and these also affect how she ultimately grows up.WorkEach year the player is given 500 gold, but the primary way of making money is earned by putting the princess to work. The princess is can work at several different jobs to earn her keep, and more jobs become available as she becomes older. While at a young age she is only able to choose from six decent jobs such as housework or waitress, eventually she is able to work in morally questionable locations like a "Sleazy Bar" and "Cabaret". Each job she can takes will modify her stats, some of them increasing and others decreasing. Which jobs affect her, and how they affect her, varies from job to job. Your job is to manage the raising and lowering of each of these stats and make the princess you are trying to make, as well as managing the amount of money she earns.SchoolGiving the princess an education costs money and each class she attends affects her stats. There are classes for raising strength and magic power for use in combat such as fencing or fighting classes, or classes that raise stats such as painting or proper etiquette. Each October there is the Harvest Festival which the player can attend and put their skills to use and win prizes like large amounts of gold or trinkets that can alter skills.AdventureThe game allows the player to send their princess on an adventure to four different locations like forests or glaciers in order to raise a warrior. These sections play out like a typical RPG, with random encounters and potions for healing. The sections follow a day/night cycle, returning the princess to her home after the days alloted are over, or if she is defeated in battle. Various stats can cause special encounters, such as meeting fairies in the forest area if the princess has high sensitivity. The player can find chests containing gold and other items which they can bring back with them.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack was composed by Masahiro Kajihara and released in Japan by NEC Avenue on Feb 21, 1995. The soundtrack contains arrangements of the music found in the game. A remastered version of the soundtrack was released in 2008.Track ListingPrincess Maker 2 SoundtrackName: Princess Maker 2Total length: 48:47"Opening" - (3:29)"Princess Maker 2" - (4:10)"Angel Of The City" - (3:35)"Go Through The Mill" - (3:28)"Battle" - (3:27)"Train In A Job" - (3:34)"Vacation" - (4:31)"The Tournament" - (5:36)"Fight It Out" - (4:21)"Kitchen" - (3:43)"When A Dream Comes True" - (4:51)"Parting Glass" - (4:02)[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Princess Minerva: Hime no Wagamama Daibouken was first created by RED Company and Riverhill Software and released on the PC-98 in 1994.A somewhat different game was developed for the PC Engine CD in 1994. This version sported animated CG cutscenes as well as voice acting. It also had a unique element where 3 parties of 3 would travel together, and one of them would be selected at random to take part in each regular battle, ensuring the need to keep all 9 characters leveled and well-equipped at all times.In 1995, the PCE version was ported by Vic Tokai to the Super Famicom, but because of the space limitations of the cartridge, all of the voice acting and nearly all the CG was cut out. A number of enemy sprites were also removed, and replaced with palette swaps of other regular enemies.[CR]Censorship[CR]The PC Engine CD version of Princess Minerva featured several scenes of nudity, both of Minerva and company, as well as the primary villainess, Dynastar, and her minions. In the Super Famicom port, scenes were modified so that the protagonists remain clothed, and numerous enemy sprites were edited so their nipples were no longer visible.The PC-98 version, in a rare and unusual case, was not as racy as the PC Engine CD entry.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Private Eye dol</title_clean>
		<plot>Some day in the near future, the crew of an "idol" (a popular culture star) takes a ride on the bus through the countryside. One of the female crew members unexpectedly faints and is taken by her friends into an abandoned mansion discovered nearby. Very soon, however, the accident begins to repeat itself, and evidence of a gruesome murder and possible ghostly presence in the mansion surfaces. Mei Star, an investigator with the team, and her computerized holographic assistant Navi must solve the mystery before it becomes too late.Private eye dol is an adventure game played for the most part from a top-down perspective. The player navigates Mei around the playable environment, examines places and items of interest, and talks to other characters. With a few exceptions, there are no puzzles in the game, and the plot is advanced by triggering events. On several occasions items must be picked up, but they are used automatically in correspondent locations.</plot>

		<title_clean>Puyo Puyo CD</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puyo Puyo is an arcade puzzle game featuring characters from Compile's Madou Monogatari RPG franchise. It is often referred to as first game of the Puyo Puyo series, despite the fact that an earlier Puyo Puyo title exists. The game was developed by Compile and published by Sega on their Mega Drive-based System C2 hardware. As opposed to its predecessor, the arcade Puyo Puyo places a heavy emphasis on competitive play; the game's single player mode consist of a 13-match gauntlet against various Madou Monogatari enemies, while the multiplayer mode pits two players against each other in a 2-out-of-3 Puyo match.The arcade version was ported to a variety of platforms. Three of these home ports would be extensively modified for worldwide release: the Genesis and Game Gear ports became Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, while the SNES port (Super Puyo Puyo) became Kirby's Avalanche.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player fighting DracoPuyo Puyo is a puzzle game with two players, although one may be controlled by the computer. Pieces come down in pairs, sometimes of different colors. When players connect at least four pieces, they "pop" those pieces, making them disappear. Two pieces are "connected" when they touch horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. Pieces that were above the popped pieces then fall down to fill the void created. The falling pieces can then create a connection of four similar colored pieces, thus causing a chain.When the player successfully pops pieces, they send "garbage" pieces are the opposing player, falling from random columns. The more pieces in a pop and the longer the chain, the more pieces are sent. These garbage pieces are uncolored and do not chain but if they are adjacent (again, vertically or horizontally but not diagonally) to a popped colored piece, then they also disappear.The player that hits the top of the well loses.Game ModesPuyo Puyo is split into two modes:Single Puyo PuyoIn the game's single player mode, the player assumes the role of Arle Nadja, a sorceress who takes pleasure in ruining Satan's plans. There are three difficulty levels: "Beginner" gives the player three easy opponents unrelated to the main game, "Normal" starts the player at Stage 1 (vs. Draco Centauros), while "Difficult" starts the player at Stage 4 (vs. Harpy). There are 13 stages in the normal game, the last of which is a battle against Satan himself.Double Puyo PuyoThis is basically multiplayer mode. In it two players play against each other. By out-chaining the other player, the player fills out his grid and that leads to victory.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ProtagonistsArle Nadja: The protagonist. She sets it as her goal to defeat Satan, after he tries to steal her beloved pet Carbuncle, which she loves more than anything. She is a sorceress that can cast Ice, Lightning and Fire.Carbuncle: Arle's beloved pet, the one Satan attempts to steal.Beginner OpponentsSkeleton T: A skeleton that loves drinking herbal tea.Nasu Grave: An eggplant that wears square glasses. He jumps up and down most of the time, as he is too slow to runMummy: An Egyptian mummy who walks around wrapped in bandagesNormal / Difficult OpponentsDraco Centauros: A half-human, half-dragon girl who can manipulate fire.Suketoudara: A fish with muscular human arms and legs.Sukiyapodes: A one-legged, baby-faced monster.Harpy: An angel-like girl that sings out-of-tune, high-pitched songs.Sasoriman: A guard disguised as a scorpion.Panotty: A flute-playing sprite who becomes enraged when Arle doesn't dance to his song.Zombie: A zombie put together by spare parts.Witch: A witch who is prone to random giggles.Zoh Daimaoh: A raging Indian elephant whose Puyo causes the screen to shake.Schezo Wegey: A dark wizard whose desire for Arle's power is comically misconstrued.Minotauros: A minotaur who serves Rulue.Rulue: A female martial artist who is madly in love with Satan. As she was not faced in combat in the original versions of Madou Monogatari, she does not have a voice clip to introduce herself with.Satan: The final boss; a horned demon man who wants to be Arle's fiance.[CR]English Localizations[CR]"Silvana" vs. "Goby Captain" in the English version of unknown origin.An English-translated version of the arcade release was released in Europe, but the authenticity of this version is disputed; it is not known whether the game was officially localized by Compile/Sega or if it is an unlicensed bootleg. In addition to adding English voice work (and removing the wings from Harpy's sprites), this version changes almost all of the character names.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puyo Puyo is an arcade puzzle game featuring characters from Compile's Madou Monogatari RPG franchise. It is often referred to as first game of the Puyo Puyo series, despite the fact that an earlier Puyo Puyo title exists. The game was developed by Compile and published by Sega on their Mega Drive-based System C2 hardware. As opposed to its predecessor, the arcade Puyo Puyo places a heavy emphasis on competitive play; the game's single player mode consist of a 13-match gauntlet against various Madou Monogatari enemies, while the multiplayer mode pits two players against each other in a 2-out-of-3 Puyo match.The arcade version was ported to a variety of platforms. Three of these home ports would be extensively modified for worldwide release: the Genesis and Game Gear ports became Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, while the SNES port (Super Puyo Puyo) became Kirby's Avalanche.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player fighting DracoPuyo Puyo is a puzzle game with two players, although one may be controlled by the computer. Pieces come down in pairs, sometimes of different colors. When players connect at least four pieces, they "pop" those pieces, making them disappear. Two pieces are "connected" when they touch horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. Pieces that were above the popped pieces then fall down to fill the void created. The falling pieces can then create a connection of four similar colored pieces, thus causing a chain.When the player successfully pops pieces, they send "garbage" pieces are the opposing player, falling from random columns. The more pieces in a pop and the longer the chain, the more pieces are sent. These garbage pieces are uncolored and do not chain but if they are adjacent (again, vertically or horizontally but not diagonally) to a popped colored piece, then they also disappear.The player that hits the top of the well loses.Game ModesPuyo Puyo is split into two modes:Single Puyo PuyoIn the game's single player mode, the player assumes the role of Arle Nadja, a sorceress who takes pleasure in ruining Satan's plans. There are three difficulty levels: "Beginner" gives the player three easy opponents unrelated to the main game, "Normal" starts the player at Stage 1 (vs. Draco Centauros), while "Difficult" starts the player at Stage 4 (vs. Harpy). There are 13 stages in the normal game, the last of which is a battle against Satan himself.Double Puyo PuyoThis is basically multiplayer mode. In it two players play against each other. By out-chaining the other player, the player fills out his grid and that leads to victory.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ProtagonistsArle Nadja: The protagonist. She sets it as her goal to defeat Satan, after he tries to steal her beloved pet Carbuncle, which she loves more than anything. She is a sorceress that can cast Ice, Lightning and Fire.Carbuncle: Arle's beloved pet, the one Satan attempts to steal.Beginner OpponentsSkeleton T: A skeleton that loves drinking herbal tea.Nasu Grave: An eggplant that wears square glasses. He jumps up and down most of the time, as he is too slow to runMummy: An Egyptian mummy who walks around wrapped in bandagesNormal / Difficult OpponentsDraco Centauros: A half-human, half-dragon girl who can manipulate fire.Suketoudara: A fish with muscular human arms and legs.Sukiyapodes: A one-legged, baby-faced monster.Harpy: An angel-like girl that sings out-of-tune, high-pitched songs.Sasoriman: A guard disguised as a scorpion.Panotty: A flute-playing sprite who becomes enraged when Arle doesn't dance to his song.Zombie: A zombie put together by spare parts.Witch: A witch who is prone to random giggles.Zoh Daimaoh: A raging Indian elephant whose Puyo causes the screen to shake.Schezo Wegey: A dark wizard whose desire for Arle's power is comically misconstrued.Minotauros: A minotaur who serves Rulue.Rulue: A female martial artist who is madly in love with Satan. As she was not faced in combat in the original versions of Madou Monogatari, she does not have a voice clip to introduce herself with.Satan: The final boss; a horned demon man who wants to be Arle's fiance.[CR]English Localizations[CR]"Silvana" vs. "Goby Captain" in the English version of unknown origin.An English-translated version of the arcade release was released in Europe, but the authenticity of this version is disputed; it is not known whether the game was officially localized by Compile/Sega or if it is an unlicensed bootleg. In addition to adding English voice work (and removing the wings from Harpy's sprites), this version changes almost all of the character names. One specific name change, Satan to "Dark Prince," is also used in the English versions of the Neo Geo Pocket Color Puyo Pop and GBA Puyo Pop.Though the Game Gear port was not released outside of Japan, playing the game in a non-Japanese system will reveal an English version named "Puzlow Kids." Notably, the ending text of Puzlow Kids's scenario mode is identical to the script of the English arcade release; this includes a mention of "the Dark Prince."

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Janshin Densetsu: Quest of Jongmaster (loosely translated to Legend of the Jong God: QUEST OF JONGMASTER) is a comedic high fantasy RPG-themed riichi mahjong (two-player variant) game developed by Aicom and released by Yubis (exclusively in Japan) for arcades (running Neo Geo MVS hardware) in 1994.The fourth and final mahjong game developed for Neo Geo hardware (utilizing memory card support for saving progress and an optional joystick/button layout), Janshin Densetsu is the spiritual sequel to Taito's earlier 1990 game Mahjong Quest. While the game is considered an erotic "strip mahjong" game (as defeating opponents reveal scantily-clad women), the game does not include explicit nudity.Like its predecessor, the game includes various RPG elements, such as experience points (where players can level up to unlock new power-ups, or "spells"), currency (where players can buy items), hit points (replacing mahjong score), and mana points (required to use spells). It also includes a high fantasy story and numerous tropes, stylized with a top-down overworld system (where the player character moves automatically) reminiscent of Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy.It was later ported to the PC Engine CD-ROM&#178; (requiring the Arcade Card add-on) on February 24, 1995 (published by NEC) and the Neo Geo CD on March 31, 1995 (published by SNK), both versions exclusive to Japan.[CR]</plot>

The player navigates the hero on small boards with branching paths; each point of interest represents a quiz "battle" against a monster, culminating in a "boss battle" on the final stage, where the player is able to select the topic of the questions (e.g. geography, movies, English language, etc.). Quiz encounters vary in length and amount of answers to choose from, but always have a time limit for each question. In addition, a separate "party mode" allows players to compete in trivia games, each consisting of three or five rounds.</plot>

		<title_clean>Quiz Avenue II</title_clean>
		<plot>Quiz Avenue II, like its predecessor, is a quiz game with a story-driven quest mode, which continues the plot of the first game. After the evil Shameless were vanquished, peace was restored in the kingdom of Erudition; however, soon demonic forces appeared on the horizon, and two young warriors, one boy and one girl, were sent by the queen to stop them.The quiz rules in this installment are largely the same as in the previous entry, with three or four answers to choose for each question and a time limit. The board advancement, however, is determined by choosing cards with the amount of steps written on them rather than by dot-to-dot movement of the first game. New is the two-player mode for the quest, in which the second player controls the heroine, and the two are answering questions simultaneously. A few new features, such as the possibility to acquire various bonuses before a quiz encounter, have been added. The party mode is replaced by the so-called "F1 Grand Prix", which is a series of trivia questions where each round is presented as a Formula 1 race.</plot>

		<plot>Quiz Caravan: Cult Q is a trivia game with four modes. The main mode involves a quiz competition in which players can choose the topics of the questions, e.g. movies, video games, history, etc. Up to five players can participate in this mode or compete against the computer AI. The "adventure mode" is a board game in which the player-controlled character's movement is determined by a dice roll. Normal fields lead to short quiz encounters; other fields may enhance the protagonist's hit points, and the final field on each stage is a more challenging "boss battle". Time attack mode involves answering correctly as many questions as possible within the allotted time limit. Finally, versus mode has players competing against each other; every right answer advances the character on a board, while the opponent is pushed back. All modes feature characters from other games published by Hudson Soft, such as Bomberman or Tengai Maky&#333; series.</plot>

		<title_clean>Quiz Marugoto the World 2 - Time Machine ni Onegai!</title_clean>
		<plot>Time Machie ni Onegai differs from its predecessor by having its own unique gameplay modes rather than strictly following a TV game show format. The Time Machine mode involves traveling to different time periods and answering trivia questions in order to trigger famous events (e.g. Moses creating a path through the Red Sea for the Jews, the belligerents of the Three Kingdoms era attacking each other, apple falling on Sir Isaac Newton's head, etc.). The questions themselves, however, have usually nothing to do with the historical event in question. Another mode in the game is called "Megaten Quest"; however, it is not a Megami Tensei related quiz, but rather an imitation of a first-person dungeon crawler with randomly appearing enemies who ask the player a certain number of question on various themes. The third mode follows the same quiz format with correctly answered questions leading to puzzle solutions, and is essentially the multiplayer portion of the game. In all modes, time limit is imposed on the entire round rather than on separate questions.</plot>

It uses a Sengoku era strategy game to frame the quizzes, with each quiz being an invasion of neighboring states. The player must answer a sufficient number of questions dependent on the region in order to successfully take it over; too many wrong answers will cause the game to end.The game was released to Arcades by Capcom themselves. It was eventually ported to the PC Engine CD-ROM (TurboGrafx-CD), Mega CD (Sega CD) and NEC PC-9801 home computer, each with a different publisher (Hudson, SIMS and SystemSoft respectively).Though it was never released outside of Japan, the game is known to western gaming audiences due to its appearance on the Japanese video game show GameCenter CX. The host memorably got various staff members with specialty subjects involved to help him answer the trivia questions successfully.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Quiz de Gakuensai is a trivia game in which the player takes the role of a high school student. One day he is entrusted with an important task of watching over his relative, a little girl. However, as soon as his girlfriend appears, the hero neglects his duty and very soon finds out that the little girl has disappeared. He has to explore the school building and find her at all costs.The player can choose the order in which the protagonist visits various classrooms in the school. In each room there is a young and attractive girl who asks the hero a series of timed trivia questions on different topics (predominantly popular culture). Both the protagonist and the girls have certain amounts of hit points; a correct answer diminishes the opponent's HP by one, while a wrong one depletes the protagonist's health by the same amount. </plot>

		<title_clean>Quiz no Hoshi - Star of Quiz</title_clean>
		<plot>Quiz no Hoshi is a trivia game with several gameplay modes; the main one is called "Heart of Stone" and is a story-driven series of quiz encounters with strategy board game elements. The plot involves a kidnapping of a little girl by the mafia, and the attempts of a boy named Hoshimaru to rescue her, all the while escaping from an impending apocalypse. Hoshimaru can be navigated over a board (often with branching paths); each field usually leads to a conversation scene with a following quiz. Both Hoshimaru and the "enemies" have life bars; the protagonist's health increases after successfully completed quiz challenges. Correct answers damage the enemy, while wrong answers deplete the hero's life. The amount of possible answer to select from and the nature of trivia questions varies from quest to quest.Other modes include a multiplayer tournament, a time attack mode in which players have to answer as many questions as possible within a time limit, and two multiplayer modes that allows players to represent various characters and mimic a fighting game and a Formula 1 Grand Prix.</plot>

		<plot>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.[CR]The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).[CR]The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</plot>

		<title_clean>Ranma 1-2</title_clean>
		<plot>Based on the popular manga/anime series of the same name, Ranma 1/2 follows the story of an aspiring martial artist who accidentally turns into a young woman by bathing in a cursed spring. He can revert to his natural form by touching hot water; however, contact with cold water will turn him into a girl again. Most of the original manga story is dedicated to semi-comical situations, based on the fact that Ranma is trying to conceal his predicament, which leads to misunderstandings, confusion, and romantic complications in his high school life.[CR]This interpretation of the license follows a part of the initial manga story, starting with the curse and going through Ranma's first conflicts with schoolmates and rival martial artists. The game is mostly structured like a "beat-'em-up" side-scroller, though there are also several boss fights that are more reminiscent of a one-on-one fighting game. The Vs. mode allows the player to recreate these boss fights using different characters. [CR]Ranma's curse becomes a gameplay feature in the game: cold and hot water turn Ranma into a girl and a boy, respectively. Female Ranma is quicker and can jump higher, but her attack and defense are lower. Anime-style cut scenes advance the story between the levels.</plot>

		<plot>Like most games based on the  Ranma 1/2 manga and anime series, Dato, Ganso Musabetsu Kakuto-Ryu! is a fighting game. Unlike the  earlier Ranma 1/2 iteration by the  same company, this game does not follow the main manga/anime story, and does not include any other gameplay elements beside one-on-one fighting. However, the game is still rich on story-telling; fully voiced anime-style cut scenes appear after each battle and serve to put Ranma in various situations and set the stage for battles against familiar character from the manga and anime, such the old pervert Happousai, Mousse, Ryuga, etc.  [CR]The Vs. mode allows two-player gameplay; the players can choose any combinations of the characters who appear in the game to test their skills. As Ranma, the player can revert to his female form (this time at will, simply by pressing a button); the female Ranma is more agile but less powerful. The combat system includes characteristic fighting game mechanics, with punches, kicks, jumps, combinations of buttons to execute specific moves, and powerful special attacks, which can be executed after charging the power.</plot>

		<title_clean>Ranma 1-2 - Toraware no Hanayome</title_clean>
		<plot>Based on the  Ranma 1/2 manga and anime series, Toraware no Hanayome consists of several chapters, which are similar to episodes of a TV show: each one has its own story and theme, but all the chapters have recurrent characters from the Ranma 1/2 universe. As in the original manga and anime, the story focuses on the young martial artist and high school student Ranma, who was cursed after bathing in a sacred Chinese spring: contact with cold water turns him into a woman, while hot water restores him to his original masculine form. Most of the story in the game is dedicated to Ranma's relationships with his schoolmates and other characters, often involving comic and/or romantic situations, as well as Ranma's attempts to get rid of the curse: in the first chapter, he tries to win a contest that would allow him to travel to China and find a way to turn him into a man permanently.[CR]Unlike most other Ranma 1/2 iterations, this game is a so-called "digital comic", which is the same as Japanese-style adventure. Controlling Ranma, the player interacts with the environment by selecting verb commands ("Look", "Talk", etc.) and objects from sub-menus. The navigation is also menu-based. Animated cut scenes appear frequently to advance the story.</plot>

		<plot>The game is based on the novel cycle Record of Lodoss War by Ryo Mizuno, and more closely on subsequent manga volumes and OVA series. Its story generally follows the one of the OVA, the main hero being Parn, a young man who grows up in a small village and later becomes one of the strongest warriors in the world, thanks to his father's mysterious heritage and his own courage. Like in the anime series, the game begins with a goblin attack and with Parn leaving his home village together with his best friend Etoh in search of adventure.[CR]This version of Record of Lodoss War is a traditional Japanese RPG with top-down world map navigation and random battles. There is a strategic element in the battles, allowing the characters to freely move on the battle field. However, the battles can be set on auto, making them more fast-paced and similar to traditional Japanese RPG combat. The towns have menu-based first-person view navigation.</plot>

		<plot>Set in the Record of Lodoss War fantasy universe, created by the Japanese writer Ryo Mizuno, this game is based on the anime Chronicles of the Heroic Knight. The story focuses on a young man named Spark, who wants to become a knight of the country of Flaim. King Kashue needs Spark to prove himself worthy of this title, and tells him to gather a band of mercenaries and prepare to stop the dark wizard Wagnard's mysterious plans.[CR]The gameplay is similar to the previous Record of Lodoss War game. Spark and his party roam the top-down world map, visiting towns, villages, and other locations on the way. Enemies appear randomly. The turn-based battles once again offer free movement on the screen, but as before, auto-battle feature can speed things up. Towns and other important locations are viewed as still screens from first-person perspective.</plot>

		<title_clean>Road Spirits</title_clean>
		<plot>Road Spirits is an arcade-style racing game, similar to  Rad Racer. The player controls a car from an "into the screen" 3rd person perspective, racing through the 17 pseudo-3D courses (named after various geographical locations, e.g. "West Coast" etc.). There are other cars on the road, which can slow down the player-controlled car by colliding with it, but the race is against time rather than against these cars. The player is given a time limit for each course, and an indicator shows how close the car is to the completion. Should the car run out of time, the race is lost, and the player has to replay it before tackling the next one.[CR]The car can be controlled with two buttons only; collisions do not damage the car, but merely make it stop; though the player can change a car model and gear system, no realistic gear-based driving is used in the game. All this contribute to the overall arcade feeling of the races.</plot>

		<title_clean>Sangokushi - Eiketsu Tenka ni Nozomu</title_clean>
		<plot>Sangokushi: Eiketsu Tenka ni Nozomu is a turn-based historical strategy game set in the Three Kingdoms era of the Chinese history and similar in concept and gameplay to Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, albeit with somewhat simpler gameplay. There is no scenario selection, and the exact timeline is not specified, though the initial situation corresponds to the phase of the war when Liu Bei and Cao Cao were the principal opposing forces. Players can choose to control any of the six most renowned warlords of the time, Liu Bei being the "default" player character with his own extended introduction and personal motives reminiscent of Luo Guanzhong's novelization of the historical events.Each warlord tries to gain dominance by building up diplomatic relationships and invading other provinces. It is possible to send offerings and diplomatic missions to other rulers, as well as manage army commanders, finances, and provision. Invasions take place on a tactical hexagonal grid, on which the player positions his forces and navigates them in turn-based fashion. When opponents meet on adjacent fields an automatic battle sequence ensues.</plot>

		<plot>On one fateful night, a purple meteor has fallen down from the skies. Harnessing its power, the Demon Folk grew stronger, and started attacking peace-loving tribes and their villages. One warrior of the bunny-eared Monbit tribe stood up against the demons. Riding a dragon, he entered the palace of the Demon King and shattered the magic amulet he was wearing. However, the warrior was gravely wounded himself. He entrusted the amulet with the tribe elder. Years have passed, and the demons are once again rearing their ugly heads. The young hero is the only one who can save the world - by using the magic amulet's power, and by befriending a dragon...[CR]Seiryu Densetsu Monbit is a traditional fantasy-themed Japanese-style RPG, with the typical progression scheme: the player navigates the hero (and other characters who join the party later) on the top-down overworld map, enters towns, buys weapons and armor, and fights randomly appearing enemies in first-person perspective, turn-based combat. One stand-out gameplay feature is the dragon egg the hero carries from the beginning of the game. As time passes, a dragon will be born, and assist the hero in various ways. For example, even as an egg, the dragon can serve as a healing item that replenishes a small amount of hit points.</plot>

		<plot>On one fateful night, a purple meteor has fallen down from the skies. Harnessing its power, the Demon Folk grew stronger, and started attacking peace-loving tribes and their villages. One warrior of the bunny-eared Monbit tribe stood up against the demons. Riding a dragon, he entered the palace of the Demon King and shattered the magic amulet he was wearing. However, the warrior was gravely wounded himself. He entrusted the amulet with the tribe elder. Years have passed, and the demons are once again rearing their ugly heads. The young hero is the only one who can save the world - by using the magic amulet's power, and by befriending a dragon...[CR]Seiryu Densetsu Monbit is a traditional fantasy-themed Japanese-style RPG, with the typical progression scheme: the player navigates the hero (and other characters who join the party later) on the top-down overworld map, enters towns, buys weapons and armor, and fights randomly appearing enemies in first-person perspective, turn-based combat. One stand-out gameplay feature is the dragon egg the hero carries from the beginning of the game. As time passes, a dragon will be born, and assist the hero in various ways. For example, even as an egg, the dragon can serve as a healing item that replenishes a small amount of hit points.</plot>

		<title_clean>Sengoku Kantou Sangokushi</title_clean>
		<plot>Sengoku Kant&#333; Sangokushi is a turn-based historical strategy game set during the Sengoku period of the Japanese history. The player can take control of one of the three prominent warlords of the era: Uesugi Kenshin, H&#333;j&#333; Ujiyasu, or Takeda Shingen. Each warlord initially controls a province with several towns, and tries to win over territory by diplomatic or military means. Every turn the player has a limited amount of moves at his or her disposal; every general has his own options, though some (e.g. marriage) are restricted to the main warlord himself.Each town has to survive and raise reputation by maintaining an army and keeping the population happy. This is achieved by trading (buying and selling rice), giving money to civilians or soldiers, developing the town, etc. Every general can also strike alliances with rulers of other provinces, sign agreements, and send spies. When an area controlled by a general is invaded by the enemy, the game switches into a top-down turn-based tactical battle mode. The player positions and navigates soldiers, engaging in automatic battles when the opponents meet on adjacent squares. Castle invasion and defense can be carried out through various means: for example, it is possible to send an assassin to dispose of the enemy general, or assign archers to fend off the invaders from castle walls.</plot>

		<plot>Sexy Idol Mahjong is, as its title implies, a mahjong game starring popular Japanese female singers and TV personalities. In the game's background plot, they are the so-called "demonic women", ruled by a nearly immortal queen residing in a castle. The player takes the role of a medieval knight who must defeat these women by playing mahjong against them. The player character automatically moves on an overhead map and plays mahjong rounds against the women in a linear fashion. Defeating these opponents may reward the player with their digitized photos, usually featuring scanty clothes and seductive poses.</plot>

		<plot>Fashion Monogatari is, like its predecessor, a mahjong game featuring digitized photos of Japanese female "idols". Gameplay-wise, however, this installment is quite different: it is a board game in which the player navigates a character by throwing dice to determine the number of moves. Like in other games of this genre, some fields bestow benefits on the player (e.g. award him money or items, invite the player to participate in bonus games, etc.). Most fields, however, lead to mahjong rounds against digitized young women, which have to be won in order to advance. Photos of scantily clad women in seductive poses serve as a reward for victory. A four-player mahjong mode is also available.</plot>

There is no story in the game; players can simply choose to compete either in four- or two-player mahjong tournaments, selecting individual participants or teams from a list. The game also contains a third mode which has nothing to do with mahjong: players select actresses who then begin to dance; players have to press buttons at the right moment to execute dancing moves.

		<plot>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.[CR]As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.[CR]Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective is an FMV adventure game and one of the first of its kind, as well as a very early CD-ROM game. It was released on PC DOS, Mac, Sega CD and TurboGrafx-CD in the early 1990s, and later saw an interactive DVD release in 1999.The game follows Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous sleuth on three separate mysteries. Each is introduced with full-motion video and then moves to a menu-driven prompt that allows the player to investigate crime scenes, listen out for rumors and send out the Baker Street Irregulars - a group of street urchins Holmes befriends in the books - to discover what they can.The game was followed by two sequels. The first of these sequels (Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective Volume II) also saw Sega CD and TurboGrafx-CD releases, but the second (Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective Volume III) was exclusive to computers. The three games were also packaged together in a compilation.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Shin Megami Tensei</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shin Megami Tensei ("True Goddess Reincarnation") is a first-person dungeon crawler originally for the Super Famicom and part of Atlus' venerable Megami Tensei series of supernatural RPGs, following from 1990's Megami Tensei II for the Famicom (and other systems). Subsequent "core" Megami Tensei games would continue to use the "Shin" prefix for sequels, leading to Shin Megami Tensei II (for SFC and other systems), Shin Megami Tensei III (a.k.a. Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne or Luficer's Call, for PS2) and Shin Megami Tensei IV (for 3DS). The extended name is also used for various SMT spin-offs, such as Shin Megami Tensei: Persona and Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner.As with other games in the series, players take the role of a nameless high-school student who attempts to defend Tokyo from an invasion of demons that threaten to turn the city into the next battlefield for the endless struggle between the forces of Law and Chaos. They proceed through areas by moving in cardinal directions in a first-person mode while taking part in mostly random turn-based battles, similar to Wizardry. Players can negotiate with and recruit demons to help their chances of survival; this is core to the series, as is understanding the relationships between demon types and their elemental strengths and weaknesses.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]From the Mega CD introThere are a variety of demons based on several religious mythologies, and each family has its own racial alignment. Players will develop a Lawful, Chaotic or Neutral alignment over the course of the story, depending on the actions they take and the demons they befriend or fight. Different alignments will result in entirely different endings for the game, all of them equally valid - although the sequel assumes the player completed the Neutral ending.The story begins, after a strange dream sequence, with the discovery of a computer program e-mailed to the protagonist by a mysterious ally, allowing him to communicate with demons and summon ones allied with him via his hand-held computer, or COMP. Shortly afterward, missing persons are reported, fellow students go missing, and the protagonist is attacked by the demons which he so conveniently now has the capability of conversing with and summoning. Attempting to unravel the reasons behind all of this (and save Tokyo) is what makes up a majority of the story.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game's first-person dungeon crawling.Movement is split into two areas. When outdoors, the game presents an overhead view of a map of the local area, and the player can move the icon representing the protagonist around the streets and into buildings. Random encounters with demons begin to hinder movement here after an early plot point. When indoors, all movement takes place in a first-person view reminiscent of old PC RPGs like Eye of the Beholder.Encounters with demons begin with an opportunity to attempt to talk before fighting. Depending on what the player says, the demons may decide to fight, run away, offer a bribe, or join the player's party and become an ally. What demons players battle and ally with will partially influence their alignment, which will affect how other demons react to them in the future. Demons whose alignment oppose the player will never join their party. Alignment can also affect what items can be equipped and what bosses are fought.A pixie appears!Once combat is initiated, the player selects actions for each party member to take. Turns occur simultaneously for both sides, with each combatant taking their action in the order of initiative as determined by their speed and other similar factors. The protagonist cannot use any spells, but most of the other characters and demons have some form of magic at their disposal. Killing a demon nets some experience and money, and each time the player character gains enough experience to increase their level, the player can select a character stat to increase. Although spells are specific to each character, all other statistics are determined by the player during the dream sequence, which means they can decide whether their team consists of glass cannon wizards or melee bruisers as they like. Players should take note, however, that this is an Atlus RPG and hence isn't very forgiving.There are also some stores in the city where the player character can purchase weapons, armor, or usable items as needed. A bit into the game, they can purchase some additional items with more useful traits, although they are very expensive.[CR]Demon Compendium[CR]Demons are ordered from highest level to lowest. Races are organized by affinity (Light-Neutral-Dark) and alignment (Law-Neutral-Chaos).

		<plot>Shin Nihon Pro Wrestling 94: Battlefield in Tokyo Dome allows the players to experience Japan's most popular professional wrestling promotion, New Japan Pro Wrestling. The game features real wrestlers from the time period it was released in. The wrestlers appear as digitized photos in the intro sequence and on the character selection screens; during gameplay, they are rendered as 2D graphical images.[CR]The game has four gameplay modes; the "battle mode" allows the player to choose one wrestler and compete against opponents chosen and controlled by the computer AI. The other modes correspond to a league, a cup (knock-out stages only), and a "versus" mode, in which the player can also choose any opponent to compete against. In every mode, the player is able to choose between single match (one-on-one) and tag team, with an additional wrestler on each side. The league mode allows competition between up to four players.[CR]The combat system is similar to that of fighting games, with a side view and health bars for the wrestlers.</plot>

		<plot>Shin Onry&#333; Senki is a remake of Onry&#333; Senki. The story and most of the dialogues remain the same as in the original release; gameplay-wise, the versions are also nearly identical, utilizing the same menu-based verb-object commands. The differences lie mostly in visual presentation and technical quality of the music. The graphics are by far more technically advanced; most locations have been re-drawn from scratch. Digitized photos are used to represent some of the characters, and anime-like style is less pronounced. Many locations and scenes have been expanded, with additional close-ups, different angles, etc. A few locations have been added or made accessible at different moments during the course of the game.</plot>

Unlike the  previous game, the entire procedure here is consensual.The gameplay abandons the Japanese adventure format with its verb icons, becoming instead a very simple, very short visual novel with just a few choices the player can make between non-interactive text and pictures. Some of these choices lead to the Game Over screen.</plot>

		<title_clean>Snatcher CD-ROMantic</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Snatcher is a cyberpunk adventure game, written and directed by Hideo Kojima. The player assumes the role of Gillian Seed, a new recruit to an elite police task force known as J.U.N.K.E.R. The player's goal is to investigate the emergence of the mysterious race known as the Snatchers, a race of cybernetic beings that kill humans and steal their appearance. The game takes place in the year 2046 on the artificial island of Neo Kobe 50 years after the explosion of a warhead destroyed large parts of eastern Europe in an event called the "Catastrophe." The game draws heavily from popular science fiction movies such as Blade Runner, Terminator, Akira and Aliens in both setting and character design as well as containing references to other Konami projects such as Metal Gear, Contra, Goemon and Castlevania. The game saw a remake which used a super-deformed art style with RPG style gameplay, known as SD Snatcher.Originally released for the NEC PC-8801 in Japan in 1988, the game has been remade several times for various platforms, including the PC-Engine CD, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The only English language translation was released for the SegaCD/MegaCD in Europe and America on December 15, 1994. The Sega CD version was the first to have light gun support, using Sega's Justifier light gun peripheral.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Shall I investigate Mika?Snatcher is a heavily text-based adventure, and most images are shown in a first person perspective, though there are a few cinematic shots. Throughout the game, the player is given a menu in order to interact with their environment. Most often, players have the 'Look' and 'Investigate' options available for interaction with the environment, and 'Use Metal Gear' and Inventory' options for other things. In special situations, players can speak with other characters, and show them items. At times, Gillian can also smell and search areas (or people). In most cases, the player must use choices more than once to get a complete picture of events and to move the story forward.There are special instances in the game where further interaction is available. First, there is one particular area that players can search with a flashlight. More commonly, the player must use their blaster to take down enemies. When the opportunity arises, players press a specified button to draw their weapon, and another button to fire. A grid is shown on the screen which the player navigates in order to take out enemies. Both of these sequences are not common occurrences. The game was originally meant to be played with a light gun for the shooting sequences.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Act 1: SnatchThis cyberpunk adventure begins as Gillian Seed begins his first day on the Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Ranger (J.U.N.K.E.R.) force, dedicated to protecting Humanity from murderous cybernetic criminals known as "Snatchers". We learn in the beginning that Gillian and his wife both have amnesia, and were discovered a few years prior. He and his wife, lacking memory of their relationship, are not seeing each other very often anymore. Gillian is shown around J.U.N.K.E.R. headquarters, where he meets Mika Slayton, the engineer Harry Benson, and the Chief Benson Cunningham. Gillian receives his blaster and his navigator, Metal Gear Mk.II. As soon as Gillian meets his partner, he receives a videophone call through Metal Gear from another J.U.N.K.E.R., Jean Jack Gibson. Jean Jack Gibson is in trouble, and needs help immediately. Gillian, though it is only his first day on the job, rushes off to complete his first task as a Junker. He rushes to the wreckage of an old building from which the call was made.Gillian with his blasterUpon arrival, the presence of an artificial pollen called Snow 9 is discovered, which is a sign of Snatcher presence. Gillian and Metal Gear go and explore the building, but all they find are the remains of Gibson's navigator, Little John, and Gibson's corpse. They discover that Gibson's head had been twisted off, something only a Snatcher would have the strength to do. They investigate to discover clues on both Gibson's corpse and Little John's memory bank. No Snatchers seem to be present, however, so the two move out to further investigate, hoping to identify the Snatcher that killed Gibson.Everyone at J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ is very hurt by the news that Jean Jack is dead, complicating the situation for Gillian. He consoles his comrades, and then moves forward in the investigation by searching Gibson's house. Gillian goes to Jean Jack's home, and speaks with his daughter, Katrina. While searching the home, he finds critical information regarding the identification of Snatchers. He learns that their artificial skin cannot cope with ultraviolet radiation, requiring them to operate at night, and use sunscreen at all times. As soon as he has this info, he moves out, hoping to utilize this to discover Gibson's murderer. Gillian also discovers an acquaintance of Jean Jack's, an informant codenamed "Napoleon". Napoleon provides information about Plato's Cavern and Outer Heaven, two places well known in the Neo-Kobe underground.Gillian's search leads him to a black market dealer and an underground restaurant, the only place in Neo Kobe that serves buffalo meat (which had been found in Gibson's stomach). He goes to this restaurant, Outer Heaven, and interrogates both the manager and one of the strippers. These interrogations give him a description of the man who must have killed Gibson, and Gillian and Metal Gear rush back to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ to use this description. The features described by the hooker at Outer Heaven lead Gillian to two suspects: Ivan Rodriguez and Freddy Nielsen. Gillian and Metal Gear first head to Rodriguez's apartment, located in a very rough area of town. When they get to his residence, Ivan comes out shooting. Gillian quickly disarms and interrogates him. Upon further investigation, evidence reveals that Ivan is not a Snatcher. All is not in vain, however, as Ivan is in possession of an illegal drug, explaining his actions, and he is later arrested by civilian police. Gillian now goes to find the other suspect, Freddy Nielsen.Gillian arrives at the Nielsen home only to discover Freddy isn't around. After questioning Nielsen's wife and searching for concrete evidence of Freddy's state, Gillian is attacked by his wife, who is a Snatcher. After killing her, Gillian and Metal Gear leave the scene, but as they do, a light comes on. They go back to figure out what happened, only to be attacked by Freddy Nielsen. Nielsen has Gillian by the neck, and Gillian seems helpless. Just before all hope is lost, a civilian bounty hunter, Random Hajile, saves Gillian.Act 2: CureGillian's first move in Act 2 is to find any information he can about the Snatchers' illicit hospital where they treat their skin. First, by searching the memory banks of Little John, an image of a neon sign that says 'Hospital Oleen' is discovered. For further information, Gillian seeks out Napoleon. Napoleon knows of an Oleen hospital, and provides Gillian with information on it for the right price. Gillian and Metal Gear rush to Oleen hospital, only to discover it is a veterinary clinic. Without bothering to investigate inside, they assume that the neon sign in the image from Little John must have been broken, and they need to find more clues.Benson's officeOnce the two finish speaking to Napoleon, they receive an urgent call concerning Katina Gibson. She had called in a panic earlier, requesting Gillian's help. Gillian immediately travels to her home, to find it torn apart. Gillian observes the scene, and finds evidence that it is a Snatcher's doing. When Gillian is just about to leave to find Katrina, Alice, the Gibsons' dog, is thrown through the window in a bloody mess. Hoping to find Katrina in one piece, Gillian and Metal Gear search for any place they may find her. When their search yields no results, they return to Gillian's apartment. Once the pair arrives at the apartment, they discover someone has been there.They enter cautiously and find that someone is using the bathroom. Slowly, they enter, and open the shower only to find Katrina, who quickly sprays Gillian in fright. Once she is decent, it is time for an explanation. Gillian questions Katrina, and she tells him why she came to his house, and what the Snatchers were doing in her home; She had found more clues. All three of them then attempt to figure out what was missing from Little John's image. They conclude that the Snatcher hospital is not "Oleen", rather, it is Queen's Hospital. With this newfound information, Gillian and Metal Gear head for their next destination.Upon arriving at Queen's Hospital, our heroes find a dark, abandoned building. It seems no one has been there for ages. The continue their investigation to find some interesting things in one of the rooms. They find a map of Russia, which is consistent with the Snatchers' strange obsession with Russia, and one piece of patient data left behind. The patient record is written in a complex form of Chinese, so the two need help to decode it. Once again, Gillian seeks the help of Napoleon.Gillian and Metal Gear find Napoleon at Outer Heaven. Luckily, Napoleon, a purebred Chinese man, knows the symbols on the patient record. It is a puzzle involving the periodic table. The group decodes the message, discovering the patient's name is 'Benson.' Shocked, Gillian rushes off to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ; there are only two Bensons he knows of. Unfortunately, neither the Chief nor Harry are at HQ. Gillian thoroughly searches the building for any clue, and finds a message from Harry. "Face to Face" is all that he left for them. Gillian further searches, realizing what this clue means. It refers to a painting in the Chief's office, an optical illusion, which shows both a vase and two faces. Gillian investigates, and discovers an image of Red Square in Moscow behind the painting. Believing that the Chief is probably a Snatcher, they leave to try and track him down. As they are leaving, they receive a videophone call from Gillian's wife, Jamie Seed. She has somehow discovered that Queen's Hospital installed a basement. This must be where they are operating from! Gillian and Metal Gear rush back to the hospital.All does not go as planned, however. As soon as they begin driving the turbocycle, they discover it has been sabotaged. Gillian constantly struggles to find a way to stop the vehicle, but to no avail. Once again, Random Hajile comes to the rescue just before Gillian meets his end. Random joins the two, and they head to the hospital.Once they arrive, they immediately search for and find the secret basement. They search all around, and eventually come across the Snatchers' morgue, containing four Human corpses. Metal Gear analyzes the bodies, to identify them and find out if the Snatchers had assumed their identities. The first two bodies are the Nielsens, the second is Chin Shu Oh, who once ran the hospital... and the third to Chief Benson Cunningham. With this new discovery, the three attempt to leave, only to encounter Chin Shu Oh and other Snatchers. All hope seems lost, but Random has one last trick up his sleeve. He tells Gillian to escape through a nearby ventilation shaft, and he uses explosives attached to himself to take down the building in a suicide attack.After the explosion, Gillian and Metal Gear find themselves in a long shaft, and observe that it was likely used by Snatchers to travel. They go further down to find it connects to an abandoned subway rail, which the Snatchers must have used to get around. They walk through the Snatcher Underground Railroad, looking for an exit. They eventually come across a ladder, which appears to take them out. They use this ladder, only to end up in the Nielsens home. They conclude this must have been how Freddy Nielsen entered the home without being noticed to attack Gillian. They had to get back to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ immediately, and leave.NapoleonTo get back to HQ, Gillian calls up a taxi. When Gillian requests he be taken to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ, the driver acts strangely. It turns out that the driver is actually Chin Shu Oh, and Gillian takes him out. Once that is over, they rush off to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ in the comandeered taxi.When Gillian arrives, he finds that someone has attacked HQ. Mika has been locked into her pod, and Metal Gear attempts to open it. Once open, they find Mika unconscious. They revive her, and she tells them that Harry ran in after Chief Cunningham, and locked the door behind. She allows them to go inside, and they dash inside to help Harry. Gillian and Metal Gear find Harry laying in a pool of his own blood. Harry tells them how he discovered that the Chief was a Snatcher, but was no match for the murderous robot. Harry then dies in Gillian's arms. Enraged, Gillian is determined to get revenge for Harry's death. Once again, he searches HQ. Gillian finds the Chief clinging to the ceiling of his office, and kills him.Act 3: JunkAct 3 begins with Gillian, Metal Gear, and Mika going over all that has happened up to that point. They discuss the Snatchers' weaknesses, those who have been discovered to be Snatchers, and the mysterious information that has been gathered. Upon studying all they know, they notice some actual links between the Snatchers and Russia, the country they're so obsessed with. It seems the Snatchers all consider this place their home.At this time, Metal Gear reveals that he actually knows all about Gillian and his mysterious past. Gillian and his wife Jamie were found cryogenically frozen in a Russian facility near the spot where the Catastrophe, a nuclear attack that devastated all of Europe, had occurred. There was one other pod, but it was empty. Jamie and Gillian both had amnesia as a result of the cryogenic suspension, and knew nothing. After inexplicably moving to Japan, Gillian joined the J.U.N.K.E.R. squad hoping it would help him recover their lost memories. Gillian also discovers that Harry Benson was he and Jamie's fully grown son.Shocking revelationsThe three decide to find the place that the Snatchers are gathered in Neo-Kobe. The conclude it must be in an area near a river from which Snow 9 originates, and a place easily accessible through the subway tunnels. All signs point to the Snatchers hiding in an old abandoned chapel, which somehow seems to line up with the Moscow river. Gillian, deciding this must be the secret hideout of the Snatchers, rushes to the scene.Unfortunately for the J.U.N.K.E.R.s, time is short. The Kyoto Summit discussing the Snatcher problem is getting together, and in approximately three hours, all authority J.U.N.K.E.R. has will be dissolved. They would also vote whether or not to completely destroy Neo-Kobe with nuclear weapons to end the Snatcher threat once and for all. Gillian must work quickly.Once Gillian and Metal Gear arrive, they find the church empty. The enter, and see a portrait of a man called "Modnar," who is clearly Random Hajile. They go further in, and find the snatchers being prepared to act as humans. They find data planning to snatch and replace many major world leaders and Gillian himself. With little time left, Metal Gear psychotically reveals that if ordered to by Kyoto, he will murder Gillian. Gillian asks Metal Gear to go out and attempt to convince the delegates in Kyoto to give him more time. Metal Gear agrees, and leaves Gillian to continue by himself.Gillian moves on, and encounters numerous Snatchers. He kills them and moves into the final chamber, where he finds Jamie, who explains how she was captured and taken to work on the development of a perfect artificial skin for the Snatchers with Dr. Modnar. Dr. Modnar was well past 100 years of age, however, and had passed on minutes before Gillian's arrival. Jamie cries about how she did it because they threatened to take their son's life, and Gillian tells her how their son, Harry, was already murdered by the Snatchers.Taking out a SnatcherAnother man reveals himself at this point. An old man in a wheelchair, Dr. Elijah Modnar. He had captured is father, the elder Dr. Modnar, to perfect his snatchers. He describes to Jamie and Gillian how he was recruited long ago to work on this project with them to simulate humans. The Snatchers were intended as a means of taking power over all other nations, the ultimate weapon. He worked on the team with Jamie, and fell in love with her. At one point in time, his only motivation to work was his love for her. Later, Gillian was hired to work with the psychological properties of the Snatchers. Jamie and Gillian fell in love and were married. Elijah was furious at this, and plotted to end it all. He set off the massive weapon Lucifer Alpha, creating the Catastrophe, and had Gillian and Jamie join him in cryogenic freezing. His plan was to leave Gillian frozen, and awaken Jamie so they could live together in peace. When he final woke up, however, he could not bring himself to do it. Instead he worked day after day, observing her silent, peaceful state. He had also realized that there would be no way he could convince her to carry on working after she realized that he'd killed billions of people because he was jealous of her love, so he left her and Gillian in suspension. Eventually, he fled, and Gillian and Jamie's bodies stayed in stasis for many years, so long that amnesia was a side effect, before they were discovered, setting the events of the game in motion.Elijah continued working on the snatchers, but could never perfect the skin. He knew his father could finish the job, so he sought his help. However, his father refused. This was no problem, as Elijah Modnar had discovered a "kinetic being" like a Snatcher, created by his father. He reveals that Random Hajile was this perfect robotic being, and by taking a sample of his skin, Elijah Modnar could perfect his snatchers and carry out his plans.The combat gridMetal Gear, strapped with explosives, appears at the scene. The delegates in Kyoto had agreed not to take action if this chapel was destroyed. In ten minutes, a blast would be sent destroying the chapel, which would qualify as Kyoto taking action. Multiple Snatchers appear to stop Jamie and Gillian's escape. Once more, Random Hajile comes to the rescue, though he was thought dead. He takes Elijah Modnar by the neck, and demands that the Snatchers stand down and let Jamie and Gillian escape. They agree, and the two escape just in time, right as the church is obliterated.The closing scene of Snatcher has Gillian and Jamie discussing their plans for the future. Gillian is preparing to take a short trip to Russia to try and regain his memory. He and Jamie plan to live together once again. Mika and Katrina come to wave him off and congratulate him on his successful mission. Mika reveals that the J.U.N.K.E.R. squad will remain intact, with a new Chief. As Gillian is about to leave, a newly fashioned Metal Gear arrives. Random dived upon him, saving him from the blast.[CR]Version Differences[CR]The first release of Snatcher was in 1988 for the NEC PC-8801 and MSX2, both on floppy disks. In order for consistent sound, the MSX2 version included an audio cartridge. Both versions ended at Act 2. The PC Engine version added the 3rd Act in addition to improving graphics and sound thanks to the CD-ROM's expanded capabilities.The Sega CD was the first iteration to support any type of light gun, utilizing Sega's Justifier.Only acceptable if this girl is 18 years or older.Some of the main changes in the English localized version of Snatcher were the result of different censorship policies in each country. The American version saw Katrina's age changed from 14 to 18, due to a shower scene and Gillian's treatment of her. At one point in Japanese version, a bare breast was shown, and it was covered up in the English version. Certain animations were also cut, such as the twitching of decapitated corpses in the game. The English version also saw customers at Outer Heaven dressed as Konami characters, while the Japanese title had the guests dressed as sci-fi characters, a change made to avoid legal problems in the west. Another change to avoid legal problems was the appearance of the Snatchers themselves, who got an overhaul in appearance to tone down their originally deliberate resemblance to the Terminator. Gillian's eye colour is changed from brown to blue in the English SEGA CD version, most likely for aesthetic purposes.In addition, Act 3 was modified to make the playing experience more interactive. Act 3's introduction and ending cutscenes were also expanded.The murder of Alice the dog in the Japan-only PS1 release of Snatcher was changed to a more decent depiction when compared to the Sega CD version; while the Sega CD shows Alice's corpse from the front, her intestines leaking from her torso, the PS1 version shows her from behind, only showing a pool of blood. [CR]Connections to Other Games[CR]Snatcher is filled with references to other Konami titles.In the Japanese version of the game, the guests inside Outer Heaven were dressed as characters from famous science fiction franchises, but these were changed to Konami characters in the English release, including Goemon from The Legend of the Mystical Ninja, Simon Belmont and Dracula from Castlevania, and Lance and Bill from Contra.The script was translated into English by Jerry Blaustein, who later translated Metal Gear Solid.The game's manual (English Sega CD) was done by Kevin O'Donohue, who did the manual for Metal Gear.There's a Moai Head mask in Napoleon's shop in reference to Konami's Gradius series shmup.The restaurant which Gillian visits for information multiple times is named Outer Heaven, the name of Big Boss's haven in the Metal Gear seriesGillian's navigator is Metal Gear Mk.II, inspired by the bipedal tanks which lend their namesake to the Metal Gear games. A non-sentient robot tool appears in Metal Gear Solid 4 as one of Solid Snake's pieces of equipment, also known as Metal Gear mk. II.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack to Snatcher was first composed by Kukeiha Club, Konami's in-house sound production team and published by King Records in 1989. It contains the MIDI sequenced soundtrack found on the MSX and PC-8801 versions of the game and features English narration throughout the album. The soundtrack for the Sega CD version was arranged by Kazuo Hashi and Yuzo Hayashi and features a more vibrant sound due to the Sega CD's cutting edge 32khz audio chip. It was released in 1992 as The Cyber Punk Adventure Snatcher -Zoom Tracks- and is the version most players will be familiar with.SnatcherSnatcherTotal length: 49:54AD 2042 Neo Kobe CityBio HazardTwilight of Neo Kobe CityEvil RippleTheme of SnatcherCreeping Silence ~Criminal Omen~ Danger Dance... &amp; Justice AllInnocent GirlTheme of JaimeDecadence BeatThe Entrance To Hell ~ Theme of IzabelTheme of KatherineTheme of JunkerBlow Up TricycleSpreading Diehard ~ Eternal Promise (Goodbye Randam)Faded MemoriesRestoration ~ Pleasure of Tention ~ Endless PursuerBeyond SorrowsMaster of Puppets Among The DiseaseTheme of EndingSnatcher: The Syber Punk Adventure -Zoom Tracks-The Syber[sic] Punk Adventure Snatcher -Zoom Tracks-Total length: 44:32Bio HazardOne Night In Neo Kobe CityTwilight of Neo Kobe CityTheme of SNATCHER (Part 1)Theme of SNATCHER (Part 2)Theme of JamiePleasure of TensionFaded MemoriesEternal Promise (Good-Bye Randam)Beyond SorrowsTear-stained Eyes [CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Snatcher is a cyberpunk adventure game, written and directed by Hideo Kojima. The player assumes the role of Gillian Seed, a new recruit to an elite police task force known as J.U.N.K.E.R. The player's goal is to investigate the emergence of the mysterious race known as the Snatchers, a race of cybernetic beings that kill humans and steal their appearance. The game takes place in the year 2046 on the artificial island of Neo Kobe 50 years after the explosion of a warhead destroyed large parts of eastern Europe in an event called the "Catastrophe." The game draws heavily from popular science fiction movies such as Blade Runner, Terminator, Akira and Aliens in both setting and character design as well as containing references to other Konami projects such as Metal Gear, Contra, Goemon and Castlevania. The game saw a remake which used a super-deformed art style with RPG style gameplay, known as SD Snatcher.Originally released for the NEC PC-8801 in Japan in 1988, the game has been remade several times for various platforms, including the PC-Engine CD, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The only English language translation was released for the SegaCD/MegaCD in Europe and America on December 15, 1994. The Sega CD version was the first to have light gun support, using Sega's Justifier light gun peripheral.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Shall I investigate Mika?Snatcher is a heavily text-based adventure, and most images are shown in a first person perspective, though there are a few cinematic shots. Throughout the game, the player is given a menu in order to interact with their environment. Most often, players have the 'Look' and 'Investigate' options available for interaction with the environment, and 'Use Metal Gear' and Inventory' options for other things. In special situations, players can speak with other characters, and show them items. At times, Gillian can also smell and search areas (or people). In most cases, the player must use choices more than once to get a complete picture of events and to move the story forward.There are special instances in the game where further interaction is available. First, there is one particular area that players can search with a flashlight. More commonly, the player must use their blaster to take down enemies. When the opportunity arises, players press a specified button to draw their weapon, and another button to fire. A grid is shown on the screen which the player navigates in order to take out enemies. Both of these sequences are not common occurrences. The game was originally meant to be played with a light gun for the shooting sequences.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Act 1: SnatchThis cyberpunk adventure begins as Gillian Seed begins his first day on the Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Ranger (J.U.N.K.E.R.) force, dedicated to protecting Humanity from murderous cybernetic criminals known as "Snatchers". We learn in the beginning that Gillian and his wife both have amnesia, and were discovered a few years prior. He and his wife, lacking memory of their relationship, are not seeing each other very often anymore. Gillian is shown around J.U.N.K.E.R. headquarters, where he meets Mika Slayton, the engineer Harry Benson, and the Chief Benson Cunningham. Gillian receives his blaster and his navigator, Metal Gear Mk.II. As soon as Gillian meets his partner, he receives a videophone call through Metal Gear from another J.U.N.K.E.R., Jean Jack Gibson. Jean Jack Gibson is in trouble, and needs help immediately. Gillian, though it is only his first day on the job, rushes off to complete his first task as a Junker. He rushes to the wreckage of an old building from which the call was made.Gillian with his blasterUpon arrival, the presence of an artificial pollen called Snow 9 is discovered, which is a sign of Snatcher presence. Gillian and Metal Gear go and explore the building, but all they find are the remains of Gibson's navigator, Little John, and Gibson's corpse. They discover that Gibson's head had been twisted off, something only a Snatcher would have the strength to do. They investigate to discover clues on both Gibson's corpse and Little John's memory bank. No Snatchers seem to be present, however, so the two move out to further investigate, hoping to identify the Snatcher that killed Gibson.Everyone at J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ is very hurt by the news that Jean Jack is dead, complicating the situation for Gillian. He consoles his comrades, and then moves forward in the investigation by searching Gibson's house. Gillian goes to Jean Jack's home, and speaks with his daughter, Katrina. While searching the home, he finds critical information regarding the identification of Snatchers. He learns that their artificial skin cannot cope with ultraviolet radiation, requiring them to operate at night, and use sunscreen at all times. As soon as he has this info, he moves out, hoping to utilize this to discover Gibson's murderer. Gillian also discovers an acquaintance of Jean Jack's, an informant codenamed "Napoleon". Napoleon provides information about Plato's Cavern and Outer Heaven, two places well known in the Neo-Kobe underground.Gillian's search leads him to a black market dealer and an underground restaurant, the only place in Neo Kobe that serves buffalo meat (which had been found in Gibson's stomach). He goes to this restaurant, Outer Heaven, and interrogates both the manager and one of the strippers. These interrogations give him a description of the man who must have killed Gibson, and Gillian and Metal Gear rush back to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ to use this description. The features described by the hooker at Outer Heaven lead Gillian to two suspects: Ivan Rodriguez and Freddy Nielsen. Gillian and Metal Gear first head to Rodriguez's apartment, located in a very rough area of town. When they get to his residence, Ivan comes out shooting. Gillian quickly disarms and interrogates him. Upon further investigation, evidence reveals that Ivan is not a Snatcher. All is not in vain, however, as Ivan is in possession of an illegal drug, explaining his actions, and he is later arrested by civilian police. Gillian now goes to find the other suspect, Freddy Nielsen.Gillian arrives at the Nielsen home only to discover Freddy isn't around. After questioning Nielsen's wife and searching for concrete evidence of Freddy's state, Gillian is attacked by his wife, who is a Snatcher. After killing her, Gillian and Metal Gear leave the scene, but as they do, a light comes on. They go back to figure out what happened, only to be attacked by Freddy Nielsen. Nielsen has Gillian by the neck, and Gillian seems helpless. Just before all hope is lost, a civilian bounty hunter, Random Hajile, saves Gillian.Act 2: CureGillian's first move in Act 2 is to find any information he can about the Snatchers' illicit hospital where they treat their skin. First, by searching the memory banks of Little John, an image of a neon sign that says 'Hospital Oleen' is discovered. For further information, Gillian seeks out Napoleon. Napoleon knows of an Oleen hospital, and provides Gillian with information on it for the right price. Gillian and Metal Gear rush to Oleen hospital, only to discover it is a veterinary clinic. Without bothering to investigate inside, they assume that the neon sign in the image from Little John must have been broken, and they need to find more clues.Benson's officeOnce the two finish speaking to Napoleon, they receive an urgent call concerning Katina Gibson. She had called in a panic earlier, requesting Gillian's help. Gillian immediately travels to her home, to find it torn apart. Gillian observes the scene, and finds evidence that it is a Snatcher's doing. When Gillian is just about to leave to find Katrina, Alice, the Gibsons' dog, is thrown through the window in a bloody mess. Hoping to find Katrina in one piece, Gillian and Metal Gear search for any place they may find her. When their search yields no results, they return to Gillian's apartment. Once the pair arrives at the apartment, they discover someone has been there.They enter cautiously and find that someone is using the bathroom. Slowly, they enter, and open the shower only to find Katrina, who quickly sprays Gillian in fright. Once she is decent, it is time for an explanation. Gillian questions Katrina, and she tells him why she came to his house, and what the Snatchers were doing in her home; She had found more clues. All three of them then attempt to figure out what was missing from Little John's image. They conclude that the Snatcher hospital is not "Oleen", rather, it is Queen's Hospital. With this newfound information, Gillian and Metal Gear head for their next destination.Upon arriving at Queen's Hospital, our heroes find a dark, abandoned building. It seems no one has been there for ages. The continue their investigation to find some interesting things in one of the rooms. They find a map of Russia, which is consistent with the Snatchers' strange obsession with Russia, and one piece of patient data left behind. The patient record is written in a complex form of Chinese, so the two need help to decode it. Once again, Gillian seeks the help of Napoleon.Gillian and Metal Gear find Napoleon at Outer Heaven. Luckily, Napoleon, a purebred Chinese man, knows the symbols on the patient record. It is a puzzle involving the periodic table. The group decodes the message, discovering the patient's name is 'Benson.' Shocked, Gillian rushes off to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ; there are only two Bensons he knows of. Unfortunately, neither the Chief nor Harry are at HQ. Gillian thoroughly searches the building for any clue, and finds a message from Harry. "Face to Face" is all that he left for them.

They eventually come across a ladder, which appears to take them out. They use this ladder, only to end up in the Nielsens home. They conclude this must have been how Freddy Nielsen entered the home without being noticed to attack Gillian. They had to get back to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ immediately, and leave.NapoleonTo get back to HQ, Gillian calls up a taxi. When Gillian requests he be taken to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ, the driver acts strangely. It turns out that the driver is actually Chin Shu Oh, and Gillian takes him out. Once that is over, they rush off to J.U.N.K.E.R. HQ in the comandeered taxi.When Gillian arrives, he finds that someone has attacked HQ. Mika has been locked into her pod, and Metal Gear attempts to open it. Once open, they find Mika unconscious. They revive her, and she tells them that Harry ran in after Chief Cunningham, and locked the door behind. She allows them to go inside, and they dash inside to help Harry. Gillian and Metal Gear find Harry laying in a pool of his own blood. Harry tells them how he discovered that the Chief was a Snatcher, but was no match for the murderous robot. Harry then dies in Gillian's arms. Enraged, Gillian is determined to get revenge for Harry's death. Once again, he searches HQ.

Dr. Modnar was well past 100 years of age, however, and had passed on minutes before Gillian's arrival. Jamie cries about how she did it because they threatened to take their son's life, and Gillian tells her how their son, Harry, was already murdered by the Snatchers.Taking out a SnatcherAnother man reveals himself at this point. An old man in a wheelchair, Dr. Elijah Modnar. He had captured is father, the elder Dr. Modnar, to perfect his snatchers. He describes to Jamie and Gillian how he was recruited long ago to work on this project with them to simulate humans. The Snatchers were intended as a means of taking power over all other nations, the ultimate weapon. He worked on the team with Jamie, and fell in love with her. At one point in time, his only motivation to work was his love for her. Later, Gillian was hired to work with the psychological properties of the Snatchers. Jamie and Gillian fell in love and were married. Elijah was furious at this, and plotted to end it all. He set off the massive weapon Lucifer Alpha, creating the Catastrophe, and had Gillian and Jamie join him in cryogenic freezing. His plan was to leave Gillian frozen, and awaken Jamie so they could live together in peace. When he final woke up, however, he could not bring himself to do it. Instead he worked day after day, observing her silent, peaceful state. He had also realized that there would be no way he could convince her to carry on working after she realized that he'd killed billions of people because he was jealous of her love, so he left her and Gillian in suspension. Eventually, he fled, and Gillian and Jamie's bodies stayed in stasis for many years, so long that amnesia was a side effect, before they were discovered, setting the events of the game in motion.Elijah continued working on the snatchers, but could never perfect the skin. He knew his father could finish the job, so he sought his help. However, his father refused. This was no problem, as Elijah Modnar had discovered a "kinetic being" like a Snatcher, created by his father. He reveals that Random Hajile was this perfect robotic being, and by taking a sample of his skin, Elijah Modnar could perfect his snatchers and carry out his plans.The combat gridMetal Gear, strapped with explosives, appears at the scene. The delegates in Kyoto had agreed not to take action if this chapel was destroyed. In ten minutes, a blast would be sent destroying the chapel, which would qualify as Kyoto taking action. Multiple Snatchers appear to stop Jamie and Gillian's escape. Once more, Random Hajile comes to the rescue, though he was thought dead. He takes Elijah Modnar by the neck, and demands that the Snatchers stand down and let Jamie and Gillian escape. They agree, and the two escape just in time, right as the church is obliterated.The closing scene of Snatcher has Gillian and Jamie discussing their plans for the future. Gillian is preparing to take a short trip to Russia to try and regain his memory. He and Jamie plan to live together once again. Mika and Katrina come to wave him off and congratulate him on his successful mission. Mika reveals that the J.U.N.K.E.R. squad will remain intact, with a new Chief. As Gillian is about to leave, a newly fashioned Metal Gear arrives. Random dived upon him, saving him from the blast.[CR]Version Differences[CR]The first release of Snatcher was in 1988 for the NEC PC-8801 and MSX2, both on floppy disks. In order for consistent sound, the MSX2 version included an audio cartridge. Both versions ended at Act 2. The PC Engine version added the 3rd Act in addition to improving graphics and sound thanks to the CD-ROM's expanded capabilities.The Sega CD was the first iteration to support any type of light gun, utilizing Sega's Justifier.Only acceptable if this girl is 18 years or older.Some of the main changes in the English localized version of Snatcher were the result of different censorship policies in each country. The American version saw Katrina's age changed from 14 to 18, due to a shower scene and Gillian's treatment of her. At one point in Japanese version, a bare breast was shown, and it was covered up in the English version. Certain animations were also cut, such as the twitching of decapitated corpses in the game. The English version also saw customers at Outer Heaven dressed as Konami characters, while the Japanese title had the guests dressed as sci-fi characters, a change made to avoid legal problems in the west. Another change to avoid legal problems was the appearance of the Snatchers themselves, who got an overhaul in appearance to tone down their originally deliberate resemblance to the Terminator. Gillian's eye colour is changed from brown to blue in the English SEGA CD version, most likely for aesthetic purposes.In addition, Act 3 was modified to make the playing experience more interactive. Act 3's introduction and ending cutscenes were also expanded.The murder of Alice the dog in the Japan-only PS1 release of Snatcher was changed to a more decent depiction when compared to the Sega CD version; while the Sega CD shows Alice's corpse from the front, her intestines leaking from her torso, the PS1 version shows her from behind, only showing a pool of blood. [CR]Connections to Other Games[CR]Snatcher is filled with references to other Konami titles.In the Japanese version of the game, the guests inside Outer Heaven were dressed as characters from famous science fiction franchises, but these were changed to Konami characters in the English release, including Goemon from The Legend of the Mystical Ninja, Simon Belmont and Dracula from Castlevania, and Lance and Bill from Contra.The script was translated into English by Jerry Blaustein, who later translated Metal Gear Solid.The game's manual (English Sega CD) was done by Kevin O'Donohue, who did the manual for Metal Gear.There's a Moai Head mask in Napoleon's shop in reference to Konami's Gradius series shmup.The restaurant which Gillian visits for information multiple times is named Outer Heaven, the name of Big Boss's haven in the Metal Gear seriesGillian's navigator is Metal Gear Mk.II, inspired by the bipedal tanks which lend their namesake to the Metal Gear games. A non-sentient robot tool appears in Metal Gear Solid 4 as one of Solid Snake's pieces of equipment, also known as Metal Gear mk. II.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack to Snatcher was first composed by Kukeiha Club, Konami's in-house sound production team and published by King Records in 1989. It contains the MIDI sequenced soundtrack found on the MSX and PC-8801 versions of the game and features English narration throughout the album. The soundtrack for the Sega CD version was arranged by Kazuo Hashi and Yuzo Hayashi and features a more vibrant sound due to the Sega CD's cutting edge 32khz audio chip. It was released in 1992 as The Cyber Punk Adventure Snatcher -Zoom Tracks- and is the version most players will be familiar with.SnatcherSnatcherTotal length: 49:54AD 2042 Neo Kobe CityBio HazardTwilight of Neo Kobe CityEvil RippleTheme of SnatcherCreeping Silence ~Criminal Omen~ Danger Dance... &amp; Justice AllInnocent GirlTheme of JaimeDecadence BeatThe Entrance To Hell ~ Theme of IzabelTheme of KatherineTheme of JunkerBlow Up TricycleSpreading Diehard ~ Eternal Promise (Goodbye Randam)Faded MemoriesRestoration ~ Pleasure of Tention ~ Endless PursuerBeyond SorrowsMaster of Puppets Among The DiseaseTheme of EndingSnatcher: The Syber Punk Adventure -Zoom Tracks-The Syber[sic] Punk Adventure Snatcher -Zoom Tracks-Total length: 44:32Bio HazardOne Night In Neo Kobe CityTwilight of Neo Kobe CityTheme of SNATCHER (Part 1)Theme of SNATCHER (Part 2)Theme of JamiePleasure of TensionFaded MemoriesEternal Promise (Good-Bye Randam)Beyond SorrowsTear-stained Eyes [CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Sol Bianca</title_clean>
		<plot>The game is based on the anim movie of the same name. In 24th century, piracy is still an issue, but no more in seas and oceans, sailing ordinary ships - the pirates are in space! The most dangerous pirate crew is the one of Sol Bianca - April, Janny, May, June, and Feb. No, those are not names of months, but five beautiful ladies, who can handle some high-tech weaponry and who think only about treasure. But the five lovely pirates are not evil - whenever some tyrant threatens a planet, they are there to help![CR]The gameplay "Sol Bianca" is that of a traditional console-style RPG. The player controls the five girls as a party, each one having individual statistics. The party of heroines visits planets, travels on the world map, and engages randomly appearing enemies in first-person perspective, turn-based combat.</plot>

		<title_clean>Sorcerian</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1987 on the NEC PC-8801 and NEC PC-9801 computers in Japan, Sorcerian was developed by Nihon Falcom and is the fifth numbered game in the Dragon Slayer series. It was later released for MS-DOS in English-speaking countries through publisher Sierra Entertainment in 1990.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a side scrolling action RPG, featuring customizable characters organized into a four person party. The player can create up to 20 male and female characters from among 4 character classes.The game features an open-ended, persistent world. Time passes in the game world, with characters growing, ageing, and eventually dying of old age.The content draws from the high fantasy tradition, and features elves, dwarves, and the like. The game is organized into 15 quests, or levels, which the player can approach through any order of their choice (&#224; la Mega Man). In turn, these quests are part of three distinct storylines, which can be played and completed in any order. The modular quest structure allows the player to leave and return to quests at any time, and play through them again at will.The game's magic system is unique and complex, requiring the combination of spells to create more powerful spells, and combining items to concoct more effective items and potions.The game features a construction kit, to add user-generated scenarios to the game, a concept influenced by Kaleidoscope. As a result, three expansions were released for Sorcerian by different developers, each expanding the original quest selection.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The game is also remembered for including music composed by Yuzo Koshiro, along with contributions from Mieko Ishikawa and Takahito Abe. Koshiro would later go on to work on the music for the Streets of Rage series.The soundtrack has been released in a variety of formats, at least five times.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]When it released in the North American market, Computer Gaming World magazine praised the unique multi-scenario system, which broke the game down into smaller quests played in any order rather than a single linear epic adventure, giving the game more variety. On the other hand, it criticized the game's unique but complex magic system, for being difficult and time-consuming. It also praised the use of puzzles to add variety to the arcade-style hack &amp; slash combat, but noted that the Japanese-style action-based combat may turn off some fans of more traditional American-style turn-based combat.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]In 2008, Platinum Games designer Hideki Kamiya listed Sorcerian as one of his favourite games of all time and an influence on his work. Later in 2014, he mentioned it as an influence on Scalebound. He stated, "It's a standard fantasy title with swords, magic and gigantic monsters," where "You can choose from 15 different scenarios in all, and if you buy the separately sold scenario set, you can play even more new adventures. This game was really full of expansive possibilities." He stated "a hydra boss appears in the first scenario, so that might be why a hydra appeared in the Scalebound promotion video." [CR]</plot>

		<plot>Sotsugyo is the first game in the  series, released only in Japan. It puts the player into a position of a high school teacher, whose goal is to successfully lead five female students to graduation within the same semester. In order to do that, the player has to study the individual characteristics of the girls. Each girl has different parameters, different strengths and weaknesses. The teacher should be careful not to overload the students with work, but letting them do what they want is not the right way either. The teacher has also control on other aspects of the students' life: it is possible to have personal conversations with the girls to motivate them, and choose leisure activities for them (such as going to the cinema). The girls can become displeased with the teacher or sick, so it's important to keep the morale high in order to achieve successful graduation.</plot>

You advance in the game by choosing various commands ("Look", "Talk", etc.). There are a few places in the game where you can die if you make a wrong decision. In the final location you'll also have to fight enemies turn-based style. The game features a large number of animated cut scenes as well as voice-overs for many dialogues.</plot>

		<plot>In the future, mankind has learned to navigate space ships. Human beings spread out to different planets of the Milky Way. The hero of the game is a young pilot named Harry. He was testing the newest spacecraft model, but it crash-landed on Menaris, a planet at the outskirts of the Eva solar system, with a medieval-like civilization. Turns out that repairing the ship will be anything but easy, so Harry decides to stay for a while and to help the inhabitants of Menaris with their problems, which involve the over-ambitious Doran Empire. With the help of Aria, princess of Menaris, Harry must discover the truth about Doran's intentions, and when he learns it, he realizes that he won't use the repaired ship to return home, but have to face something that threatens the entire galaxy...[CR]Star Breaker is a fairly traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down view, world map navigation, random turn-based battles, and all the other usual ingredients. Battles can be set on Auto for quicker pacing. Since the setting of the game is a mixture of sci-fi and medieval fantasy, character use a variety of weapons from swords to guns, as well as special psychic attacks. There are also some space ship combat in the game, and it is possible to upgrade the player's ship later on.[CR]Like many other Turbo CD RPGs, Star Breaker utilizes anime-style cut scenes and voice acting during important events.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Star Parodier is a 1992 spin-off and parody of Hudson's Star Soldier series. It features gameplay similar to the core series, but the stages and playable ships instead have a fantastical, comedic spin. It is thought to be Hudson's answer to Konami's Parodius series.Players can choose from 3 "ships": Bomberman, PC Engine, and Paro-Caesar (the regular Star Soldier ship). Each ship has three unique weapons. Players can also change the ship speed at at any time. Most levels are in some way related to other Hudson developed games, such as the Bomberman-themed stage.Star Parodier was a PC Engine CD-ROM&#178; exclusive until 2008, when it was added to the Wii's Virtual Console library for the US and Europe and made available in those territories for the first time. It followed the Star Soldier main series title Final Soldier onto the service, which had also been a PC Engine CD-ROM&#178; exclusive up until that date. Star Parodier had been slated for a TurboGrafx-CD release, as Fantasy Star Soldier, but this version was canceled mid-development.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>In Startling Odyssey, the player takes the role of a young boy named Leon. One day, his home villages is attacked by monsters. His best friend is killed, and the most powerful magician of the village is turned into stone and abducted by the monsters' leader. Leon receives the blessing of the village elder and begins his quest to avenge the death of his friend and to defeat the demonic forces that threaten the land.[CR]This is a rather traditional Japanese RPG, with all the familiar ingredients: Leon (and his companions who later join the party) roams the world map, entering towns and dungeons, buying equipment and items, and engaging randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. The battles are viewed from first-person perspective. Characters can use regular attacks as well as magical spells, and the battles can be also set on Auto.</plot>

		<plot>Nariagari Trendy is an adaptation of the Japanese board game sugoroku - the Monopoly-like "Game of Life" version rather than the backgammon variant. Four characters, controlled by human players or computer AI, move on a board that represents a city, earning money and points on the way. The characters are taken from other Laser Soft games, most prominently Cosmic Fantasy series. The amount of moves is determined by dice roll. Special fields would award the character that lands on them with large amounts of money, the opportunity to roll the dice again, or lead to various mini-games which would increase the character's possessions. Another type of fields leads to a store run by the cat Nyan from Cosmic Fantasy games, who offers special cards for money.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Albatross is a golf game for the PC Engine CD-ROM peripheral. Like many games for the peripheral, it boasts animated cutscenes and a redbook audio track. The player can create their own custom character for the game's standard Training mode, or they can follow a specific protagonist through a storyline in the game's sequential Match Play mode. Interstitial cutscenes in the story sets up each of the opponents the player must face to reach the tale's conclusion.Beyond its dramatic story, the game is a typical console golf sim of the era: The player views each hole from a top-down bird's eye view, selecting a club appropriate for their present distance from the flag. Rather than a visible power gauge, the player has to intuit the strength of the swing from how far back the player character brings their club before releasing the swing button at the desired amount. The player character will always aim directly for the flag unless the player selects a new direction, which is often necessary on holes where the fairway curves around obstacles.The game was developed by Telenet Japan's CD division Laser Soft. It was not released outside of Japan. [CR]</plot>

		<plot>Yup, it's Daisenryaku. And don't think the neat CD storage capabilities will improve upon the tried-and-true formula; it's still Daisenryaku. It does include some neat sound effects though. Like all Daisenryaku games, this is for the hardcore only. No hand-holding here, just a bunch of maps for you to play. Still, it's pretty fun, even if it IS pretty slow, and you don't know what you're doing half the time. Maybe all the true hardcore armchair generals will find it more fun, I think.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Now just so you know, the stats for the units repeat themselves in the ISO like, hundreds of times, so you'll probably eventually see some Japanese here and there, but I think it's okay enough to still be considered complete. Come on, even we at the Whirlpool aren't THAT picky. Aside from that, this is a great-looking translation, so check it out if you feel so inclined.[CR]Reviewer: Spinner 8[CR]https://www.romhacking.net/trans/513/[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mahjong Taikai ("Taikai" means "tournament" or "competition") is a mahjong game published by KOEI for the Super Famicom (SNES) and PC Engine CD-ROM (TurboGrafx CD) platforms. It is part of Koei's ongoing series of Mahjong Taikai games, which began with Mahjong Taikai for the NEC PC-9801 and Famicom. Unlike many early Mahjong games, Super Mahjong Taikai supports three CPU opponents rather than the truncated one-vs-one format that was an unfortunate necessity due to a lack of computing power.The Taikai games feature many odd characters as CPU opponents, often taken from Koei's strategic simulation games. For instance, Napoleon and Nobunaga Oda are selectable CPU opponents.[CR]Links[CR]Super Mahjong Taikai (soundtrack)Super Mahjong Taikai (japanese wikipedia)[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Super Schwarzschild</title_clean>
		<plot>Super Schwarzschild is a spin-off entry in the Schwarzschild series. The game's scenario is based on that of Schwarzschild II. The story is much more elaborate and character-specific; unlike the earlier game, there is a linear plot advanced through dialogue and anime-style cutscenes. The player takes control of Alcion, the crown prince of the Auraclume kingdom, who is forced to terminate his studies abroad and return to his country in order to defend it against a treacherous enemy.The gameplay system is vastly different as well; as opposed to the main entries in the series, Super Schwarzschild is not a grand strategy game. The gameplay is confined to much smaller areas and is also significantly more linear and mission-oriented. Rather than presenting free-form gameplay and interaction with a multitude of nations, the game is restricted to a single military conflict. Diplomacy options are completely gone; finances, resource management, and research have been simplified. Much of the game is dedicated to military strategy and tactics, involving arming and deploying ships. Battles are actively controlled by the player; they take place on separate small screens and require the player to navigate ships and attack enemy craft in turn-based fashion.</plot>

		<title_clean>Super Schwarzschild 2</title_clean>
		<plot>The follow-up to Super Schwarzschild offers an original scenario that takes place after the Great Somari War. Like other Schwarzschild games, it is set in the 40th century and portrays a complex political and military situation within a star system. The events of the game take place in or around the once powerful kingdom of Istramu, which was severely weakened by the king's death. Temporary leaders replaced each other, and the instability led to a global revolt in the surrounding space. The player takes the role of various characters belonging to the resistance movement.Like the previous game, Super Schwarzschild has less grand strategy elements than the main Schwarzschild installments, and focuses on smaller-scale military strategy and tactics. There are no diplomacy options; resource management and research are simplified. There are more belligerents and somewhat more freedom in strategic planning than in the preceding game. Battles take place on separate screens and follow a turn-based tactical model. Similarly to the predecessor, the game features extensive cutscenes and dialogue that advance the plot.</plot>

		<title_clean>Taiheiki</title_clean>
		<plot>Taiheiki is a turn-based strategy game based on the Japanese 14th century historical epic of the same name. Like the book, the game portrays the struggle between the Northern Court, ruled by the decadent H&#333;j&#333; clan (later betrayed by their vassal Ashikaga Takauji), and the Southern Court of the emperor Go-Daigo. The gameplay has strong grand strategy elements and is similar to Koei's "historical simulation" series. The player can choose to control either the Northern or the Southern forces, choosing the actions for the leader and all his vassals. The player can choose to engage in diplomacy with rulers of other provinces, sign agreements, and manage and navigate armies. Combat takes place on a separate top-down grid, on which he player navigates the soldiers in turn-based fashion. Individual battles proceed automatically, their outcome based on the participant's attributes.</plot>

		<plot>Tanjo: Debut puts the player into the role of a music company agent, who has to work with three potential stars of entertainment: three young girls named Aki, Kumi, and Saori. In the beginning of the game, the player views the statistics of each girl and her personality description. Afterwards, the training begins. Most of the game is spent planning schedules for the girls. Practicing music skills, working, having a vacation - everything has an influence on the girls' statistics. It is important to keep the girls happy and reduce their stress; at the same time, having vacations without practicing will diminish their professional skill. Keeping the right balance is the key here.[CR]After a period of training, the player chooses which specific branch he/she wants the girls to compete in: commercial photos (model), staging a musical, performing a pop concert, making a movie, etc. Depending on the player's preparations and previous training, the girls will get higher or lower ratings. The player-controlled group competes against other agencies in a league, and results are shown after each major event.</plot>

		<plot>Tecmo World Cup Super Soccer is quite different from the similarly-named Tecmo World Cup Soccer. In this football (soccer) game players can choose between competing for the World Cup or participating in the Japanese league tournament. Only eight international teams (Brazil, Argentine, Japan, England, France, Spain, Italy, and Germany) are available. Before a match begins players can choose between three general strategies for the team - normal, offensive, or defensive. Weather conditions (normal, rain, or snow) and match length can be selected as well. The game itself is played from a third-person perspective that slightly switches between isometric and top-down depending on the situation. </plot>

		<title_clean>Tenchi Muyou! Ryououki</title_clean>
		<plot>Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-oki is based on the manga and anime series Tenchi Muyo, in particular the 20-episode OVA Tenchi Muyo: Ryo-ohki (same name as the game, but with a slightly different official romanization). The story centers around a seemingly ordinary boy Tenchi Masaki, who lives in the countryside on the Earth. After accidentally releasing a spaced pirate named Ryoko, his modest house attracts the attention of powerful people from space, including an officer of the Galaxy Police, a famous scientist, and two sisters from a royal family in search of their long-lost half-brother. Soon Tenchi finds out the truth about his own identity and his super-powers, but still can't quite handle a household with five attractive young women, some of which seem to have a special interest in him...[CR]The game is a traditional Japanese-style adventure: no puzzles, but many situations during which the player has to make choices. These choices lead to branching story lines, which in their turn lead to different endings. The game is viewed from first-person perspective, beside navigation around Tenchi's house, which uses a platform view.</plot>

		<plot>Deden no Den is a promotional version of Bomberman '94 with limited distribution. The game was only available through Hudson's newsletter at their Caravan Tournament. It contains only one level of the full game (2 to 5-player modes only), but replaces the titular character with Kabuki Danj&#363;r&#333;, a popular character from Tengai Maky&#333; games. Players control up to five Kabukis in differently-colored outfits.</plot>

		<plot>Kearu, a young warrior from the land of Erin, is entrusted by his village elder to protect Krea, a young girl who was found near the village entrance when she was a baby. The young couple receives a task of retrieving and delivering a magic flower known as Eureka to the king. However, on the way to the castle, they are attacked by a winged monster, who carries Krea away. Kearu realizes that this kidnapping was not accidental, and had something to do with Krea's mysterious origin.[CR]Tenshi no Uta is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game. As in most games of this genre, the player navigates the party of heroes on the top-down world map, fighting randomly appearing enemies, gaining experience for further automatic leveling-up, and money to buy better weapons, armor, and items. The battles are viewed from first-person perspective, with the enemy graphics super-imposed on the exploration screen (like in  Cosmic Fantasy 2). The game has the conventional HP and MP bars, with the heroes learning various attack, support, and healing spells as dictated by their level.[CR]There is a day/night cycle in the game. Shops are closed at night, and certain characters appear only at a specific day time.</plot>

		<plot>Fate is a young man whose job is to patrol the land around his village and protect it from monsters. One day, during such a patrol, Fate and his friend Shion encountered a mysterious girl in the nearby tower. She could only remember that her name was Rhianna, but nothing else about her origins and how she ended up being in that tower. Shortly afterwards, the village was attacked by monsters and burnt down. Fate, Shion, and Rhianna escape, and Fate promises Rhianna that he will help her regain her memory and find the truth about her past...[CR]Tenshi no Uta II: Datenshi no Sentaku is not directly related to its  predecessor story-wise (though it is set in the same universe, and some characters from the previous game make an appearance here). Graphically and gameplay-wise, it is nearly identical to it, beside a few minor tweaks (such as characters regaining full health after level up): an archetypal Japanese-style RPG with random enemies, turn-based combat, linear story progression, and automatic character growth without any extras. Like the first game, Datenshi no Sentaku has a day/night cycle.</plot>

		<title_clean>Top o Nerae! GunBuster Vol. 1</title_clean>
		<plot>Top o Nerae! GunBuster Vol.1 is based on the anime OVA series Gunbuster by Gainax. In the early 21th century humanity discovered a race of bug-like aliens while colonizing known space. The aliens steadily advance towards the Earth with the goal of eradicating it. To counter that, humans have developed giant mechas that ca be navigated by trained pilots. The story of the game follows closely the first chapter of the anime, focusing on the young pilot Noriko Takaya and her first steps towards the mastery of her dangerous profession.The game has a Japanese-style adventure-like interface (with Look, Talk, and other verb commands leading to sub-menus), but plays more like a cross between an interactive movie (with animated scenes and voice-overs) and a visual novel, where choices of actions and responses play a dominant role. Every wrong action raises the heroine's "stress meter"; once it is full, the game is over.</plot>

		<title_clean>Top o Nerae! GunBuster Vol. 2</title_clean>
		<plot>Top o Nerae! GunBuster Vol.2 is a direct sequel to the first episode based on the Gunbuster anime series. It continues the story started in the first chapter, following the adventures of the young mecha pilot Noriko Takaya as she passes the test and is admitted into the fighting squad of mechas, sent on a mission to stop an insectoid race of aliens from destroying the Earth.Gameplay-wise, the second episode differs from the previous one in that it eschews even the rudimentary Japanese-style adventure commands. It plays more like a pure interactive movie: the player watches animated, voiced scenes and from time to time has to make a decision for Noriko, influencing subsequent scenes. The "stress meter" from the preceding game has been removed as well. The game also contains extras such as character and robot introduction, a radio drama, and a "rock-paper-scissors" game against Noriko.</plot>

		<title_clean>Uchuu Senkan Yamato</title_clean>
		<plot>Uch&#363; Senkan Yamato is based on the anime series Space Battleship Yamato, also known as Star Blazers. The events of the game follow those of the initial episodes. In the end of the 22nd century, Gamila aliens bombard Earth with radioactive meteorites. As a result, the planet's surface becomes uninhabitable, and humans begin to dwell underground. Using the ruins of the World War II Japanese battleship Yamato, humans construct a powerful spaceship and can finally engage the aliens in direct confrontation.This incarnation of the series is essentially a real-time strategy game with a somewhat unusual approach to the genre. Rather than navigating units on battlefields, the player takes direct control of every crew member onboard the ship. Each one of them is responsible for a certain function (supplying power, manning a gun, turning the ship, etc.); in order to win battles, it is crucial to coordinate their actions. The game proceeds in real time, but pauses when the player accesses crew members and performs actions for them.</plot>

To avoid this predicament, the player can also press directional buttons to move the girl around. When on the ground, the unsavory objects turn into power-ups. The girl removes an item of her clothes after each successfully completed level, until she begins to jump nakedA simple stationary first-person shooter game, in which the player has to shoot a young woman who is trying to capture various wild animals. Shooting the animals, on the other hand, gradually leads to a Game Over.

The protagonist is Ataru Moroboshi, a high school student who accidentally evokes love in the heart of Lum, the princess of an alien demon-like race.

Ataru and Lum must explore the high school building and find out what happened to Shinobu.&amp;#x0D;[CR]&amp;#x0D;[CR]The gameplay is that of a traditional Japanese-style adventure, where all interaction (including navigation) is performed by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects from a list. game progression is fairly linear, and it is typically required to complete an objective in one location in order to be able to proceed to the next one. There are no real puzzles, but an inventory with items that can be examined is present.</plot>

		<title_clean>Valis II</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The PCE version front.Valis II is a scrolling action game, in the vein of Castlevania. In its North American incarnation, it was one of the first batch of titles published in 1990 to exploit the CD-ROM attachment for the TurboGrafx-16 console. Where the scope of the game would not have been considered remarkable (especially given its six stage length), the inclusion of brief animated cut scenes, and recorded voices that played back in advance of boss encounters, proposed to display the benefits of CD-ROM for gaming. The releases on various home computer systems are markedly different: while most of the same characters are involved and the storyline is much the same, the stages, enemies, items, and general systems are quite different, and in many ways this earlier iteration is a superior game. The X68000 version is the best looking of the home computer versions, with the MSX version being the most inferior.[CR]CHARACTERS[CR]Yuko AhsoYuko: The main character; an otherwise ordinary high school student chosen to wield the legendary sword of Valis on behalf of the world of Vecanti (the dream world).Reiko: Yuko&#8217;s best friend &#8211;or, rather, former best friend, who now appears in this game as only a ghost to alert Yuko to events in the dream world. In the opening cut scene of the PC Engine version we are treated to a recreation of their encounter from the original Valis game, in which Yuko is forced to kill Reiko in a duel.Queen Krisoval ValiaQueen Kristoval Valia: The good Queen of the light side of Vecanti, and the person who granted Yuko the sword. She has called on Yuko again to save Vecanti. She is terminally ill and dies in the PC Engine version; in the home computer version Megas cruelly murders her.Emperor MegasEmperor Daimon Megas : the antagonist of Valis II. He is currently involved in a civil war in Vecanti to solidify his power; Although King Rogures (the villain of Valis 1) is dead, there are a number of loyalists who refuse to submit to him (and who also attack Yuko in an effort to get the Valis sword to overthrow him!) He was also the rightful heir to the throne, but his own father conspired against him with Rogures, injuring him badly (resulting in his cybernetic aspects) and imprisoning him for a long period of time. As it turns out, he isn't really evil per se, but simply doesn't believe that the people of Vecanti can be united without a strong leader. He feels he and Yuko are the same, both abandoned by their parents. His motivations are much the same in the home computer version, although he is noticeably more cruel and sadistic. Like many of the villains of Valis 2, his full name is revealed in the end credits of the home computer version.Ke ke ke!Baluf de Dalis: Emperor Megas' sycophantic majordomo. He resembles a mechanical chameleon. He is not present in the PC Engine version of the game. He dies when Magus' castle is destroyed in a catastrophic explosion.Jordano Haizen: Megas' top general in the home computer version, and also one of three top generals in the PC Engine version. He is present in both games, albeit he has an expanded role in the home computer version, arriving to take the Valis jewelry Gaius gives Yuko after his defeat.Gyome Gaius: A character named Gaius is present in both versions of the game, but otherwise they are essentially different characters. In the home computer version, he is the last of Rogures' loyalist generals, and upon defeat gives Yuko a piece of Valis jewelry and wishes that she will be able to destroy Megas. In the PC Engine version Gaius is a general of Megas' army who is occupying Queen Valia's castle, Vanity.Tou: Megas' final general, he is rather whiny and is only in the PC Engine version. He desperately begs Megas for help in his battle against Yuko, only to be rebuffed.Zaluga: The boss of the first stage in both versions of the game, he is one of the last surviving generals of the Rogures loyalist army. His appearance is only slightly different in the home computer version, but he is much larger than in the PC Engine version and has very different attacks.Giran: The final General of the loyalist faction in the PC Engine version, he is unceremoniously cut in half by Megas.[CR]The PC Engine Version[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]Moving primarily from left to right, Yuko must navigate the landscape while slashing oncoming enemies with her sword. Each stage features a mid-stage boss (or several!) and a final boss. At the end of each stage, the game will save its progress automatically.Items and Power-UpsThere are a variety of items and power-ups in Valis 2 which fall in to several different categories.Special Weapons:Normal: The basic shot type. Picking up additional power ups will increase its strength.Cutter: A strong, crescent shaped projectile. Picking up additional power ups will increase its strength.Homing: A simple homing missile-type shot. It is the weakest of the various projectile types.Dual: Allows Yuko to shoot two shots at once, one straight forward and one upwards at an angle.Defense Items:Speed Up: Resembling a boot, this increases Yuko's movement speed.Shield: This item increases Yuko's defense, resulting in her taking less damage from enemies.Power Up: Resembling a sword, this increases Yuko's attack power and the level of her special weapon.Vitality: Increases the length of Yuko's life bar permanently, so long as Yuko doesn't die.Special Items:Crush: Resembling a lightning bold, this item deals damage to all enemies on the screen.Invisibility: Makes Yuko invulnerable for a short period of time.Time Stop: Temporarily stops enemy actions.Option Barrier: Two spheres which protect Yuko orbit around her.Other Items:1up: Grants Yuko an extra life.Crystal: Picking these up results in a 1000 point bonus.Big Life: A red heart that restores a substantial amount of Yuko's depleted life energy.Small Life: A blue heart which restores a small amount of Yuko's life energy.StagesStage 1: Yuko is suddenly attacked by monsters after having a nightmare. She has no choice but to fight back against their onslaught, taking the fight to first the streets of Tokyo and then the subway system! This stage features both Stinger and Gadel as mini-bosses. At the end of the stage a Rogures loyalist general, Zaluga, demands the Valis sword and attempts to kill Yuko to take it from her.Stage 2: Yuko enters the world of Vecanti and fights across its bleak and foreboding landscape, encountering many strange creatures and more of the Rogures loyalist forces. The last of the loyalist generals, Giran, attempts yet again to take the sword from Yuko in a cavernous hall of bone. Unfortunately for Giran, his ambitions are cut short as Emperor Megas himself makes an appearance and brutally kills him before challenging Yuko to come to his palace.Stage 3: Queen Valia's castle, Vanity, has been occupied by Emperor Megas' forces. Yuko must liberate it by defeating them! The leader of the occupying forces is General Gaius, the first of Megas' top three generals. Valia is unfortunately terminally ill and passes on, revealing that Yuko is Valna's sister who had been sent to the human world.Stage 4: Yuko heads to Megas' castle to stop his forces from conquering all of Vecanti. The environment in this area is increasingly hostile, with flaming men and strange bubble creatures harassing Yuko at every turn. Skeletal dragons also stalk the land. The boss is the second of Megas' top generals, Strange White Haizen. Here, all Haizen does is spin rapidly at Yuko while burrowing in to the ground and re-emerging elsewhere.Stage 5: Megas' castle at last! Unlike Rogures' castle, it is heavily mechanized and factory-like; it is also full of conveyors, gears, and sparking electrodes! Face-hugger like creatures are being grown in tubes in the background, and some that have gotten lose aren't above attacking Yuko. Several terrifying swordsmen called Alfes patrol the area as well. Waiting at the end for Yuko is Tou, the third and final of Megas' generals.Stage 6: The approach to Megas' throneroom! Yuko rides through a Giger-esque elevator shaft while being assaulted by the various strange defenders of Megas' inner sanctum. Upon reaching the summit, Yuko fights Magus himself, first in his bio-mechanical life support system and then against a star field. Upon defeat, Yuko observes that Megas wasn't genuinely trying to hurt her, and the whole truth is revealed.[CR]The Home Computer Version[CR]The home computer version of the game is decidedly different from the PC Engine version; however, the differences between the various home computer versions (MSX, PS-9800, X68000, etc.) are mostly graphical in nature.SystemAs previously mentioned, the systems of the home computer version are rather different than the PC Engine version. Yuko is capable of getting multiple outfits and weapons and retaining them; she can switch between them at will on a menu screen. Each weapon and several suits have multiple levels. In addition, Yuko is also capable of picking up and learning several different magic spells.WeaponsThe various weapons found throughout the game. All weapons have four levels of power.Bullet: The first special weapon Yuko finds in the game, this allows her to fire simple projectiles whenever she attacks. It is relatively weak, and a square hit from the sword is still considerably stronger. As Yuko levels it up, she fires multiple bullets that spread simultaneously.Laser: A stronger weapon than the bullet. However,does not spread, even after leveling. At level 4, it also shoots out of Yuko's back.Cluster: Yuko creates spheres which move in an arc back and forth slightly in front of and above her which eventually fly towards the enemy. Rather strong and quite useful in a variety of situations. It can even block some enemy shots!Exploder: This weapon is necessary to complete the game. Yuko fires shots which explode. It is needed to break through some walls. At higher levels, the explosion gets larger and more powerful.Hunter: A weak homing type weapon that resembles boomerangs. Yuko fires additional shots when it is leveled.MagicThere are several kinds of magic for Yuko to collect throughout the course of the game. All magic uses Valis jewels.Diff: The first spell Yuko finds in the game. It temporarily freezes enemies. However, note that not all enemies are vulnerable to it, and enemy bullets will not stop moving even if this spell is cast! Cost: 5 jewels per cast.Evade: Reduces the damage taken by Yuko from enemy shots for a short period. Cost: 10 jewels per cast.Integral: Renders Yuko invulnerable for a very short period of time. Cost: 15 jewels per cast.Crash: Destroys all basic enemies on the screen. Cost: 20 jewels per cast.SuitsYuko gets a wide variety of outfits! Both the defense and offense suit have 3 levels of power.Yuko in her offense suit.Pajamas: Yuko's starting outfit. Worthless.Sailor Fuku: Classic school uniform. Offers slightly higher HP than the pajamas.Blazer: A more mature school uniform. Offers an HP max of 12 rather than the sailor fuku's 10.Valis Suit: The original Valis suit offers yet more HP.Offense Suit: This suit is the first suit Yuko obtains with multiple levels. It significantly increases her maximum HP, by an amount which increases at each level! An all-around good suit.Defense Suit: The second suit found with multiple levels. Does not offer the same HP max as the offense suit (24 instead of 30 at level 1) However, it also reduces the damage received by Yuko by a percentage, starting at 25%. However, it also reduces the level of Yuko's weapons!Reiko Suit: This suit is in essence "cursed"; it reduces Yuko's HP and weapon level compared to what they should be by the time Yuko finds it, and it can't be removed without the help of a special item.Hyper Suit: The best suit in the game. It is automatically obtained in the final stage.Miscellaneous ItemsItems which don't quite fall in to any other category!Red Valis Jewel: This gives Yuko one jewel point.Blue Valis Jewel: This gives Yuko 10 jewel points.Recovery: An item found near the end of every stage, it fully restores Yuko's life.Jump power: First found in stage 2, where it permanently boosts Yuko's jumping ability. It is later found in stages 4 and 6, where it grants her the power of flight. However, it constantly drains Yuko's jewel stock in these two stages, and if it runs out, she's doomed!Curse breaker: Allows Yuko to remove the Reiko suit if she put it on.StagesStage 1: Yuko has a dream where Reiko's spirit tells her to prepare and that her power is needed again; she awakes in the middle of the night only to be attacked by a monster! Yuko takes the fights to the streets as she is assaulted by Rogures loyalists who are desperate to get the valis sword in an effort to turn around their floundering campaign against Megas. The boss is Zaluga, a loyalist general. The player is greeted with the message "Zaluga is making arumbling of the earth!" upon arriving at his location, and indeed he begins the battle by causing an earthquake and erupting from the ground. He is quite large and after bursting from the ground attacks Yuko with a barrage of shots from his mouth, all while blocking many of her attacks with his mighty hand. His face is his weak point.Stage 2: Yuko enters the world of Vecanti again, only to have what Reiko said in her dream confirmed: Vecanti is being dominated by a fierce new ruler, Emperor Megas. The jump power is found near the beginning of this stage and is needed to progress. After fighting through oceans of snails, Yuko encounters the vile beast Sondern, a huge creature with many regenerating "soreheads". Yuko must defeat all of its heads in one pass, otherwise they will all regenerate endlessly! After defeating all the regenerating heads, Sondern's body collapses and its true head bursts forth.Stage 3: Yuko passes through a cave on her journey, encountering even more snails, strange drill-like animals and other nasties. The exploder is first found in this stage, and is necessary to complete it, as many walls block Yuko's progress. At the end, Gaius, the last of the loyalist generals to Rogures (in a role very different to the one he has in the PC Engine version!) first attacks Yuko with a gigantic effigy of Rogures, then attacks her himself.Stage 4: Megas explodes on to the scene in a cloud of thunder and a gigantic bio-mechanical battleship! Yuko must fight (and fly) her way through this auto-scrolling stage or fall victim to the numerous turrets and strange bio-mechanical creatures swarming inside. The battleship's commander is Strange White Haizen, Megas' top commander. After the bizarre message "Heizen was manipulated by his occiput!" flashes across the screen, Yuko does battle with him while flying. Armed with a variety of lasers and a rocket punch, Haizen is more bluster than anything else. After his primary body is destroyed, he continues the fight as a spider which consists of his head and part of his back.Stage 5: With Valia having been captured by Megas, Yuko storms his castle in an effort to rescue her. Yuko must avoid spikes and fight through various types of guards on her way, some more conventional and others more of the spinning, laser-shooting bug variety. The boss is a rather phallic beast called Bazoon that produces huge numbers of larva. Queen Valia is murdered by Megas, and Megas is about to kill Yuko when the spirit of Reiko arrives to rescue her. Equipping the Valis jewelry, Yuko is finally granted the hyper suit!Megas has been defeated.Stage 6: The final stage. With Megas' castle destroyed, Yuko battles her way to Megas through a blazing cave full of fireballs and prominences. With a shout of "You will be driven from Pillar to Post!" from Megas, Yuko is forced to fight Megas himself! He begins the battle by throwing off his cape which transforms in to a number of small dragons. He then attacks Yuko himself directly. Upon suffering serious injury, he transforms in to a bigger and stronger form capable of flight and firing large projectiles at Yuko. Enjoy the ending after his defeat!The omake screen at the end, telling players how they can send away for a Yuko garage kit!After the end credits, a special extra scene is displayed![CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Valis II</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The PCE version front.Valis II is a scrolling action game, in the vein of Castlevania. In its North American incarnation, it was one of the first batch of titles published in 1990 to exploit the CD-ROM attachment for the TurboGrafx-16 console. Where the scope of the game would not have been considered remarkable (especially given its six stage length), the inclusion of brief animated cut scenes, and recorded voices that played back in advance of boss encounters, proposed to display the benefits of CD-ROM for gaming. The releases on various home computer systems are markedly different: while most of the same characters are involved and the storyline is much the same, the stages, enemies, items, and general systems are quite different, and in many ways this earlier iteration is a superior game. The X68000 version is the best looking of the home computer versions, with the MSX version being the most inferior.[CR]CHARACTERS[CR]Yuko AhsoYuko: The main character; an otherwise ordinary high school student chosen to wield the legendary sword of Valis on behalf of the world of Vecanti (the dream world).Reiko: Yuko&#8217;s best friend &#8211;or, rather, former best friend, who now appears in this game as only a ghost to alert Yuko to events in the dream world. In the opening cut scene of the PC Engine version we are treated to a recreation of their encounter from the original Valis game, in which Yuko is forced to kill Reiko in a duel.Queen Krisoval ValiaQueen Kristoval Valia: The good Queen of the light side of Vecanti, and the person who granted Yuko the sword. She has called on Yuko again to save Vecanti. She is terminally ill and dies in the PC Engine version; in the home computer version Megas cruelly murders her.Emperor MegasEmperor Daimon Megas : the antagonist of Valis II. He is currently involved in a civil war in Vecanti to solidify his power; Although King Rogures (the villain of Valis 1) is dead, there are a number of loyalists who refuse to submit to him (and who also attack Yuko in an effort to get the Valis sword to overthrow him!) He was also the rightful heir to the throne, but his own father conspired against him with Rogures, injuring him badly (resulting in his cybernetic aspects) and imprisoning him for a long period of time. As it turns out, he isn't really evil per se, but simply doesn't believe that the people of Vecanti can be united without a strong leader. He feels he and Yuko are the same, both abandoned by their parents. His motivations are much the same in the home computer version, although he is noticeably more cruel and sadistic. Like many of the villains of Valis 2, his full name is revealed in the end credits of the home computer version.Ke ke ke!Baluf de Dalis: Emperor Megas' sycophantic majordomo. He resembles a mechanical chameleon. He is not present in the PC Engine version of the game. He dies when Magus' castle is destroyed in a catastrophic explosion.Jordano Haizen: Megas' top general in the home computer version, and also one of three top generals in the PC Engine version. He is present in both games, albeit he has an expanded role in the home computer version, arriving to take the Valis jewelry Gaius gives Yuko after his defeat.Gyome Gaius: A character named Gaius is present in both versions of the game, but otherwise they are essentially different characters. In the home computer version, he is the last of Rogures' loyalist generals, and upon defeat gives Yuko a piece of Valis jewelry and wishes that she will be able to destroy Megas. In the PC Engine version Gaius is a general of Megas' army who is occupying Queen Valia's castle, Vanity.Tou: Megas' final general, he is rather whiny and is only in the PC Engine version. He desperately begs Megas for help in his battle against Yuko, only to be rebuffed.Zaluga: The boss of the first stage in both versions of the game, he is one of the last surviving generals of the Rogures loyalist army. His appearance is only slightly different in the home computer version, but he is much larger than in the PC Engine version and has very different attacks.Giran: The final General of the loyalist faction in the PC Engine version, he is unceremoniously cut in half by Megas.[CR]The PC Engine Version[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]Moving primarily from left to right, Yuko must navigate the landscape while slashing oncoming enemies with her sword. Each stage features a mid-stage boss (or several!) and a final boss. At the end of each stage, the game will save its progress automatically.Items and Power-UpsThere are a variety of items and power-ups in Valis 2 which fall in to several different categories.Special Weapons:Normal: The basic shot type. Picking up additional power ups will increase its strength.Cutter: A strong, crescent shaped projectile. Picking up additional power ups will increase its strength.Homing: A simple homing missile-type shot. It is the weakest of the various projectile types.Dual: Allows Yuko to shoot two shots at once, one straight forward and one upwards at an angle.Defense Items:Speed Up: Resembling a boot, this increases Yuko's movement speed.Shield: This item increases Yuko's defense, resulting in her taking less damage from enemies.Power Up: Resembling a sword, this increases Yuko's attack power and the level of her special weapon.Vitality: Increases the length of Yuko's life bar permanently, so long as Yuko doesn't die.Special Items:Crush: Resembling a lightning bold, this item deals damage to all enemies on the screen.Invisibility: Makes Yuko invulnerable for a short period of time.Time Stop: Temporarily stops enemy actions.Option Barrier: Two spheres which protect Yuko orbit around her.Other Items:1up: Grants Yuko an extra life.Crystal: Picking these up results in a 1000 point bonus.Big Life: A red heart that restores a substantial amount of Yuko's depleted life energy.Small Life: A blue heart which restores a small amount of Yuko's life energy.StagesStage 1: Yuko is suddenly attacked by monsters after having a nightmare. She has no choice but to fight back against their onslaught, taking the fight to first the streets of Tokyo and then the subway system! This stage features both Stinger and Gadel as mini-bosses. At the end of the stage a Rogures loyalist general, Zaluga, demands the Valis sword and attempts to kill Yuko to take it from her.Stage 2: Yuko enters the world of Vecanti and fights across its bleak and foreboding landscape, encountering many strange creatures and more of the Rogures loyalist forces. The last of the loyalist generals, Giran, attempts yet again to take the sword from Yuko in a cavernous hall of bone. Unfortunately for Giran, his ambitions are cut short as Emperor Megas himself makes an appearance and brutally kills him before challenging Yuko to come to his palace.Stage 3: Queen Valia's castle, Vanity, has been occupied by Emperor Megas' forces. Yuko must liberate it by defeating them! The leader of the occupying forces is General Gaius, the first of Megas' top three generals. Valia is unfortunately terminally ill and passes on, revealing that Yuko is Valna's sister who had been sent to the human world.Stage 4: Yuko heads to Megas' castle to stop his forces from conquering all of Vecanti. The environment in this area is increasingly hostile, with flaming men and strange bubble creatures harassing Yuko at every turn. Skeletal dragons also stalk the land. The boss is the second of Megas' top generals, Strange White Haizen. Here, all Haizen does is spin rapidly at Yuko while burrowing in to the ground and re-emerging elsewhere.Stage 5: Megas' castle at last! Unlike Rogures' castle, it is heavily mechanized and factory-like; it is also full of conveyors, gears, and sparking electrodes! Face-hugger like creatures are being grown in tubes in the background, and some that have gotten lose aren't above attacking Yuko. Several terrifying swordsmen called Alfes patrol the area as well. Waiting at the end for Yuko is Tou, the third and final of Megas' generals.Stage 6: The approach to Megas' throneroom! Yuko rides through a Giger-esque elevator shaft while being assaulted by the various strange defenders of Megas' inner sanctum. Upon reaching the summit, Yuko fights Magus himself, first in his bio-mechanical life support system and then against a star field. Upon defeat, Yuko observes that Megas wasn't genuinely trying to hurt her, and the whole truth is revealed.[CR]The Home Computer Version[CR]The home computer version of the game is decidedly different from the PC Engine version; however, the differences between the various home computer versions (MSX, PS-9800, X68000, etc.) are mostly graphical in nature.SystemAs previously mentioned, the systems of the home computer version are rather different than the PC Engine version. Yuko is capable of getting multiple outfits and weapons and retaining them; she can switch between them at will on a menu screen. Each weapon and several suits have multiple levels. In addition, Yuko is also capable of picking up and learning several different magic spells.WeaponsThe various weapons found throughout the game. All weapons have four levels of power.Bullet: The first special weapon Yuko finds in the game, this allows her to fire simple projectiles whenever she attacks. It is relatively weak, and a square hit from the sword is still considerably stronger. As Yuko levels it up, she fires multiple bullets that spread simultaneously.Laser: A stronger weapon than the bullet. However,does not spread, even after leveling. At level 4, it also shoots out of Yuko's back.Cluster: Yuko creates spheres which move in an arc back and forth slightly in front of and above her which eventually fly towards the enemy. Rather strong and quite useful in a variety of situations. It can even block some enemy shots!Exploder: This weapon is necessary to complete the game. Yuko fires shots which explode. It is needed to break through some walls. At higher levels, the explosion gets larger and more powerful.Hunter: A weak homing type weapon that resembles boomerangs. Yuko fires additional shots when it is leveled.MagicThere are several kinds of magic for Yuko to collect throughout the course of the game. All magic uses Valis jewels.Diff: The first spell Yuko finds in the game. It temporarily freezes enemies. However, note that not all enemies are vulnerable to it, and enemy bullets will not stop moving even if this spell is cast! Cost: 5 jewels per cast.Evade: Reduces the damage taken by Yuko from enemy shots for a short period. Cost: 10 jewels per cast.Integral: Renders Yuko invulnerable for a very short period of time. Cost: 15 jewels per cast.Crash: Destroys all basic enemies on the screen. Cost: 20 jewels per cast.SuitsYuko gets a wide variety of outfits! Both the defense and offense suit have 3 levels of power.Yuko in her offense suit.Pajamas: Yuko's starting outfit. Worthless.Sailor Fuku: Classic school uniform. Offers slightly higher HP than the pajamas.Blazer: A more mature school uniform. Offers an HP max of 12 rather than the sailor fuku's 10.Valis Suit: The original Valis suit offers yet more HP.Offense Suit: This suit is the first suit Yuko obtains with multiple levels. It significantly increases her maximum HP, by an amount which increases at each level! An all-around good suit.Defense Suit: The second suit found with multiple levels. Does not offer the same HP max as the offense suit (24 instead of 30 at level 1) However, it also reduces the damage received by Yuko by a percentage, starting at 25%. However, it also reduces the level of Yuko's weapons!Reiko Suit: This suit is in essence "cursed"; it reduces Yuko's HP and weapon level compared to what they should be by the time Yuko finds it, and it can't be removed without the help of a special item.Hyper Suit: The best suit in the game. It is automatically obtained in the final stage.Miscellaneous ItemsItems which don't quite fall in to any other category!Red Valis Jewel: This gives Yuko one jewel point.Blue Valis Jewel: This gives Yuko 10 jewel points.Recovery: An item found near the end of every stage, it fully restores Yuko's life.Jump power: First found in stage 2, where it permanently boosts Yuko's jumping ability. It is later found in stages 4 and 6, where it grants her the power of flight. However, it constantly drains Yuko's jewel stock in these two stages, and if it runs out, she's doomed!Curse breaker: Allows Yuko to remove the Reiko suit if she put it on.StagesStage 1: Yuko has a dream where Reiko's spirit tells her to prepare and that her power is needed again; she awakes in the middle of the night only to be attacked by a monster! Yuko takes the fights to the streets as she is assaulted by Rogures loyalists who are desperate to get the valis sword in an effort to turn around their floundering campaign against Megas.

		<title_clean>Valis III</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Let's all have some fun!The final volume of the Valis story arc to feature Yuko as the main character, this action platformer was released in America in both its Genesis and TurboGrafx-16 CD incarnations. The PC Engine version was released first in Japan on September 7, 1990, with the Mega Drive version following a little under a year later. Apart from improved graphics and level design, one additional tweak to the Valis series came in the form of additional player characters &#8211;in addition to Yuko, the player could switch to Cham and Valna (once acquired), each with their own weapon and magic sets.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Layzus and Valis.Yuko has been living a normal life again since the events of Valis II; however, a crisis is at hand in Vecanti! King Grames of the devil world has come and conquered, and he has his sights set on merging both of these worlds with reality! He is also somehow in possession of the Layzus sword, the twin and opposite of the Valis sword and long thought lost. Cham comes and attempts to steal the Valis sword as Yuko sleeps to avenge her murdered father... what will Yuko do?[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Incorporating the familiar action platforming style found in Castlevania, as well as previous Valis games, the player must navigate each stage to find and defeat the boss of that level. In addition to the usual jump and attack, Valis III introduces a sliding maneuver for the characters as well. Characters can also "high jump" by holding up during a jump. Yuko, Valna and Cham can each be selected at will for their appropriate skills (some levels cannot be completed without using Valna&#8217;s magic, for example).Yuko's ice cutter.A weapon gauge displays the current power of the player&#8217;s weapons, and power up icons can be collected during play to increase that level. The weapon power bar refills over time, and the more full the bar is the stronger the attack; thusly, attacking rapidly is much weaker than allowing the attack to charge and then striking. Magical attack power ups take the form of Fire, Ice and Thunder, which are shared by all three characters, but each with different results. There is no longer a point score as in previous Valis games, so collected crystals will instead fill the player&#8217;s magic meter.[CR]Items[CR]A 1up.Several items are found throughout the game; they are contained in "item boxes". Break them open to see what's inside.Heal: Restores 4 points of life.Recover: Restores 16 points of life.S magic: Restores 2 magic points.B magic: Restores 8 magic points.Power up: Raises a character's weapon power level by 1.Energy speed: Increases the rate at which the weapon energy bar refills.1up: Grants the player an extra life.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Yuko again.Yuko: A high school student in the human world, chosen by queen Valia in the original game to wield the sword of Valis.Fire Dagger: Causes several small fiery daggers to form and float behind Yuko; they home in and attack enemies.Ice Cutter: Yuko fires a shot straight forward which can freeze enemies solid.Thunder Sword: A burst of energy strikes all enemies on the screen.ValnaValna: The princess of Vecanti (the dream world), and Yuko&#8217;s twin sister. Her weapon is a staff which fires projectiles; she focuses mainly on magic. Heavy usage of her ice magic is necessary to complete some parts of the game. Her fire magic is heat spinner, her ice magic is death cube, and her thunder magic is thunder storm.Heat Spinner:Death Cube:Thunder Storm:ChamCham (Char in the US Turbo CD version): A refugee from the devil world whose father was executed by Grames. She enters reality in order to steal the sword of Valis and have her revenge on Grames, but ends up befriending Yuko. Her weapon of choice is a barbed whip. Her fire magic is fire dragon, her ice magic is ice arrow, and her thunder magic is lightning bolt.Fire Dragon: Cham creates a fire dragon that homes in on enemies and is active for a long period of time.Ice Arrow: Cham fires projectiles to her left and right which can freeze enemies.Lightning Bolt: Cham fires a spread of lightning bolts in multiple directions.GramesKing Grames (King Ramses in the US Turbo CD version): The new leader of the Vecanti, he is the leader of the Raffine clan and is originally from the world of devils. He is armed with the dreadful Layzus sword, a twin of the Valis sword and allegedly equal in power. He is attempting to merge all three worlds together, but in the end he has the more insane goal of combining the two sword's power so as to challenge the gods. He also happened to murder Cham's father as he was opposed to Grame's goals of invasion.I crave vengeance!Rogures (Rogles in the US games): The villain of the original Valis game, he has been returned to life. He agrees to work for Grames in an opportunity to get revenge on Yuko.Zalude.Zalude: One of Grames' generals, met fairly early in Valis III as a boss fight. He makes a bizarre cameo appearance in Valis IV as well. Ohohohoho!Asura: An icy General of Grames, he is very vain and a narcissist. His pre-battle dialogue with Valna is an obnoxious "laugh-off".Wise men have beards.Nizetti: After testing Yuko with a harrowing trial, he unlocks her true power.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Stage 1: Cham attempts to make off with the Valis sword, but unfortunately minions of Grames have followed her and attempt to take the sword themselves. Yuko has to rescue Cham from a ball-and-chain wielding devil. After rescuing Cham, she becomes playable!Stage 2: Yuko and Cham travel to the dream-world of Vecanti; Grames' forces have already arrived and conquered! Yuko and Cham must traverse a mountain pass, fighting past scorpion men and other bizarre creatures on the way. On the path several wounded soldiers inform them Vanity Castle has been taken and Valna has been imprisoned. A devilish winged soldier of Grames awaits at the top of a waterfall for our heroines.Stage 3: A spooky forest on the way to the tower were Valna is held! Our heroines are immediately assaulted by invisible soldiers and chomping jaws. A mysterious ferryman offers to take the girls across the lake, but he can only take one at a time...fishmen assault whoever was chosen on the way, but wait! It was all a trap, and the ferryman is the boss. He transforms in to a rather weak serpent.Stage 4: The tower where Valna is held! Yuko (or Cham, as they're still separated) must scale the tower and fight off the various guards. Valna is imprisoned in a crystal at the top! After freeing her, Valna must fight the stage boss, the fire devil Koriranba, on her own.Stage 5: Yuko and co. head to the sacred place called Sazarland to meet with Nizetti, who (according to Valna) can unlock the true power of the Valis sword. Probably the most infamous stage in the game, heavy usage of Valna's death cube magic is vital to pass the stage. At the end, a bell must be rung a number of times to prove the hero is worthy to enter Sazarland!The coinage of the Gods.Stage 6: After proving themselves worthy, our heroines must test their resolve by climbing Nirvan Road, a path which leads to the heavens. Along the way, Yuko encounters the spirits of some of her departed comrades (I.E., Reiko and Valia) Yuko must face an onslaught of soldiers to test her bravery!The horror!Stage 7: King Grames dispatches his generals to dispose of Yuko! Arriving in the Grames' devil world, our heroines traverse a frightful graveyard, populated by typically graveyard-esque denizens. Flying bloody crosses attempt to impale our protagonists, and huge mounds of bones are a testament to the terrible rule of Grames. Rogures awaits Yuko at the end, eager for revenge! He's not afraid to use some of his same old tricks, but he also has a newfound fondness for knives!Stage 8: Continuing on their way, Yuko and co. pass through a desert full of the remains of long-dead giant creatures. Of course, no video game desert is complete with giant ant lions and sand dwelling fish! Zalude awaits at the end to attack our heroines with an array of saw blades and a mighty shoulder tackle!Stage 9: Next stop, an icy cave! Flying ammonites float casually though the air, and ice-men hurl themselves suicidally at our ladies in an all-out effort to stop their advances. Asura waits at the end of the caves, eager to prove his beauty and strength. He teleports and leaps about, hurling a variety of projectiles as he does so.The tower of King Grames.Stage 10: Grames hasn't been sitting idly by during all this; he's invaded the human world! His foreboding tower has sprung up in the middle of Tokyo; it's time for Yuko and friends to make a final stand, scale his tower and take him down! Grames will be the toughest opponent Yuko has ever faced; she'd better be ready! He's capable of everything Yuko can do, and more!We'll miss you, Yuko!Nevertheless, Grames falls before Yuko's sword; for her long and hard work, Yuko ascends to Godhood in the ending. Thusly a new path opens for the people of the devil world and the people of the dreamworld Vecanti to co-exist peacefully.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the scores of 8,8,7,8 stating, "...this is the best of the Valis trilogy yet!"[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Valis III</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Let's all have some fun!The final volume of the Valis story arc to feature Yuko as the main character, this action platformer was released in America in both its Genesis and TurboGrafx-16 CD incarnations. The PC Engine version was released first in Japan on September 7, 1990, with the Mega Drive version following a little under a year later. Apart from improved graphics and level design, one additional tweak to the Valis series came in the form of additional player characters &#8211;in addition to Yuko, the player could switch to Cham and Valna (once acquired), each with their own weapon and magic sets.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Layzus and Valis.Yuko has been living a normal life again since the events of Valis II; however, a crisis is at hand in Vecanti! King Grames of the devil world has come and conquered, and he has his sights set on merging both of these worlds with reality! He is also somehow in possession of the Layzus sword, the twin and opposite of the Valis sword and long thought lost. Cham comes and attempts to steal the Valis sword as Yuko sleeps to avenge her murdered father... what will Yuko do?[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Incorporating the familiar action platforming style found in Castlevania, as well as previous Valis games, the player must navigate each stage to find and defeat the boss of that level. In addition to the usual jump and attack, Valis III introduces a sliding maneuver for the characters as well. Characters can also "high jump" by holding up during a jump. Yuko, Valna and Cham can each be selected at will for their appropriate skills (some levels cannot be completed without using Valna&#8217;s magic, for example).Yuko's ice cutter.A weapon gauge displays the current power of the player&#8217;s weapons, and power up icons can be collected during play to increase that level. The weapon power bar refills over time, and the more full the bar is the stronger the attack; thusly, attacking rapidly is much weaker than allowing the attack to charge and then striking. Magical attack power ups take the form of Fire, Ice and Thunder, which are shared by all three characters, but each with different results. There is no longer a point score as in previous Valis games, so collected crystals will instead fill the player&#8217;s magic meter.[CR]Items[CR]A 1up.Several items are found throughout the game; they are contained in "item boxes". Break them open to see what's inside.Heal: Restores 4 points of life.Recover: Restores 16 points of life.S magic: Restores 2 magic points.B magic: Restores 8 magic points.Power up: Raises a character's weapon power level by 1.Energy speed: Increases the rate at which the weapon energy bar refills.1up: Grants the player an extra life.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Yuko again.Yuko: A high school student in the human world, chosen by queen Valia in the original game to wield the sword of Valis.Fire Dagger: Causes several small fiery daggers to form and float behind Yuko; they home in and attack enemies.Ice Cutter: Yuko fires a shot straight forward which can freeze enemies solid.Thunder Sword: A burst of energy strikes all enemies on the screen.ValnaValna: The princess of Vecanti (the dream world), and Yuko&#8217;s twin sister. Her weapon is a staff which fires projectiles; she focuses mainly on magic. Heavy usage of her ice magic is necessary to complete some parts of the game. Her fire magic is heat spinner, her ice magic is death cube, and her thunder magic is thunder storm.Heat Spinner:Death Cube:Thunder Storm:ChamCham (Char in the US Turbo CD version): A refugee from the devil world whose father was executed by Grames. She enters reality in order to steal the sword of Valis and have her revenge on Grames, but ends up befriending Yuko. Her weapon of choice is a barbed whip. Her fire magic is fire dragon, her ice magic is ice arrow, and her thunder magic is lightning bolt.Fire Dragon: Cham creates a fire dragon that homes in on enemies and is active for a long period of time.Ice Arrow: Cham fires projectiles to her left and right which can freeze enemies.Lightning Bolt: Cham fires a spread of lightning bolts in multiple directions.GramesKing Grames (King Ramses in the US Turbo CD version): The new leader of the Vecanti, he is the leader of the Raffine clan and is originally from the world of devils. He is armed with the dreadful Layzus sword, a twin of the Valis sword and allegedly equal in power. He is attempting to merge all three worlds together, but in the end he has the more insane goal of combining the two sword's power so as to challenge the gods. He also happened to murder Cham's father as he was opposed to Grame's goals of invasion.I crave vengeance!Rogures (Rogles in the US games): The villain of the original Valis game, he has been returned to life. He agrees to work for Grames in an opportunity to get revenge on Yuko.Zalude.Zalude: One of Grames' generals, met fairly early in Valis III as a boss fight. He makes a bizarre cameo appearance in Valis IV as well. Ohohohoho!Asura: An icy General of Grames, he is very vain and a narcissist. His pre-battle dialogue with Valna is an obnoxious "laugh-off".Wise men have beards.Nizetti: After testing Yuko with a harrowing trial, he unlocks her true power.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Stage 1: Cham attempts to make off with the Valis sword, but unfortunately minions of Grames have followed her and attempt to take the sword themselves. Yuko has to rescue Cham from a ball-and-chain wielding devil. After rescuing Cham, she becomes playable!Stage 2: Yuko and Cham travel to the dream-world of Vecanti; Grames' forces have already arrived and conquered! Yuko and Cham must traverse a mountain pass, fighting past scorpion men and other bizarre creatures on the way. On the path several wounded soldiers inform them Vanity Castle has been taken and Valna has been imprisoned. A devilish winged soldier of Grames awaits at the top of a waterfall for our heroines.Stage 3: A spooky forest on the way to the tower were Valna is held! Our heroines are immediately assaulted by invisible soldiers and chomping jaws. A mysterious ferryman offers to take the girls across the lake, but he can only take one at a time...fishmen assault whoever was chosen on the way, but wait!

		<title_clean>Valis IV</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Valis IV is the last game in the Valis series. Like the earlier games, it was released on multiple platforms, and as was also the case in the past the games have sizable differences depending on the platform. It was released on both the PC Engine and Super Famicom/SNES.As usual, the basic story is the same in all of the versions of the game. This time, the Red Moon has risen in the sky signifying the return of King Galgia, a terrifying fiend imprisoned long ago on Vecanti. He quickly decimates and conquers Vecanti and has set his sights on the world of humans, Earth. Lena Bland sets out on a journey to obtain the Valis Sword and defeat Galgia.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Lena Bland:The game's protagonist. A member of the resistance against Galgia, she is brave and strong. She uses a sword, and eventually (of course) the Valis sword. 16 years old. She is playable in both versions (and is in fact the only playable character in the SFC/SNES version) Am: Another member of the resistance, she is Lena's younger sister. She is a bit of a slacker and somewhat goofy, but she can be counted on to help her sister. She wields a bird-shaped boomerang fired from a rod and can double jump. 14 years old. She is not playable in the SFC version, but is implicitly there as her grave is seen. So you're saying I was a deadbeat dad?Asfar:Actually Galgia's father, and a former king. While no saint, he is not actually evil. He joins and fights alongside Lena and Am to stop his son's reign of terror and to come to terms with the fact he was a bad father. He is not present in the SFC version of the game. He wields a staff which fires wolf-heads made of energy, and because he's such a tough guy, he takes no damage from spikes. Cham: Returning from Valis III, she is now the leader of Vecanti. The monsters are on good terms with the humanoids since the death of Grames, the previous king of the monsters. She is also the leader of the resistance against King Galgia. Valna:Yuko's sister also returns. She has been kidnapped and imprisoned by Galgia. Yuko:The heroine of all the previous Valis games, Yuko Aaso is now a goddess who protects the Sword of Valis. Will she judge Lena worthy of becoming the next Phantasm Soldier? General Dhalgen:The first of King Galgia's generals, he dominates Vecanti from Vanity Castle. He is the torso of a man growing out of the back of a tiger, an obvious homage to "Duke Gorgon" of Mazinger fame. In both games, he is capable of jumping around the room, firing a large crescent projectile from his sword that pushes the opponent away and damages them, and spitting fireballs from his tiger head. General Medius:The second of Galgia's generals, and the only female general. In the PCE version, she challenges Lena inside of Crystal Pillar. In the SFC version, she is in control of Valhalla. General Luzard:The last of Galgia's three generals, his speciality is the "jet steam crush". In the PCE version he is guarding Valna on top of Crysal Pillar, while in the SFC version he challenges Lena on the surface of Red Moon. Galgia, King of the Red Moon:The game's primary antagonist. Imprisoned long ago by the Gods of Vecanti, he now possesses the Titan Ring, an item that gives him almost insurmountable power. He hates his father and was jealous of his father's power when younger. He is responsible for the death of Am, as she takes an attack intended for Valna. In both versions of the game he is fought in the core of Red Moon, although he has multiple forms in the PCE version. He challenges his father in his normal form, then he fights Lena in a powered-up form and eventually turns in to a giant disembodied head and set of hands which are fought in a field of stars. In the SFC version, he simply remains in his normal form (although he does fire some bullets at Lena from the comfort of his throne before actually attacking!)[CR]The Super Famicom/SNES version[CR]In the SFC version of the game, only Lena Bland is playable. She is capable of several basic actions, including running, jumping, and attacking. She can also shoot magic bullets (the player holds "up" and attacks to fire these.) There are a number of items in this game. Up to six can be held in reserves; if another item is picked up, it replaces the item furthest to the left of the item bar and moves all the remaining items to the left by one space, appearing on the far right. At the end of the game, Yuko appears to judge the player's performance based on a variety of criteria.ItemsHeart: A single use item. This heals some lost energy when used.Armor: A single use item. When this is used, Lena transforms and wears Valis armor. This makes her immune to damage for five hits, after which she returns to normal.Three way: This item replaces Lena's basic magic bullet when used. This allows Lena to shoot three beams up at various angles by perform the normal motion for the magic bullet. This item can be used 20 times before it wears off.Bomber: This item replaces Lena's magic bullet when used. Bomber shoots a powerful blast straight forward. This item can be used 10 times before wearing off.Search: This item also replaces Lena's magic bullet when used. Re-using the "wolf head" sprites of Asfar's attack from the PCE version, Lena fires wolf-heads that follow the terrain (they move up hills, etc.) This item can be used 20 times before expiring.Homing: Again, this replaces Lena's basic magic bullet. Lena fires flaming dragons that home in on enemies. This item can be used 20 times before expiring.StagesThe DS-30 custom!The SFC/SNES version of the game has seven stages, or "acts".Stage 1: VecantiVecanti is in ruination from Galgia's overwhelming attacks. The boss of this stage is DS-30kai. It is also a boss in the PCE version, although of a much later stage, and its actions are completely different. The enemies in this stage are: deadhead, flying shears, and lance guarder.Stage 2: Vanity CastleOnce the seat of Queen Valia's power, it has a tendency to be taken over by villains. Currently it is occupied by General Dhalgen. The enemies in this stage are: dead head, lance guarder G, and spectre.Stage 3: BabylonWater and ruins abound on Lena's journey to see Yuko. The boss of this stage is Nornil, a shape-shifting statue with three forms (a statue, a harpy, and a mermaid.) This boss is unique to the SFC version of the game, although the harpy sprite is also used in the PCE version for a different boss. The enemies in this stage are: okimono, lash, and technical monkey.Stage 4: ValhallaYuko's dominion. General Medius is in control of this area in the SFC version. In this game, Medius attacks by creating multiple fake images of herself and diving rapidly at Lena. Occasionally she drops to the platform to fire a large orange projectile or two at Lena. The enemies in this stage are: seraph, death flower, high priestess, siren, and arch elf.Stage 5: Crystal PillarFormerly King Galgia's prison, it is now his base of operations on Earth. The boss of this stage is the core of Crystal Pillar, and is unique to the SFC version. It is protected by "Final Guarder", which is also an enemy from the PCE version's final stage. This version of "Final Guarder" is invincible, the core must be targeted. The enemies in this stage are: sword guarder, tower grey, disc guarder.Look out, it's the Jet Stream Crush! Stage 6: The surface of Red MoonFloating foetuses and strange copies of Lena abound. General Luzard challenges Lena at the end of this stage. He floats around shooting lasers out of the eyes on his chest at Lena, switching sides periodically. He then performs his "jet stream crush", moving back and forth quickly from one edge of the screen to the other, gaining speed each time.The enemies in this stage are: redmoon meteor, beyond, beyond Lena, and okimono.Stage 7: Red Moon's coreGiant pulsating spheres and re-used music from Babylon signal that Lena's journey is coming to an end. Galgia's three generals are fought again, afterwhich King Galgia himself challenges Lena to a final duel. There are no regular enemies present in this stage. Galgia has a large number of projectile attacks at his disposal. He "blocks" attacks with his halberd and cannot be hit unless he stops blocking (he is also vulnerable when jumping.) When his life has been reduced by a certain amount, he fires various patterns of green foetus bubbles at Lena which restore his health by a fairly large margin should they make contact.The ranking system. After the game is completed, Yuko judges the player's skill based on a variety of factors: The number of items picked up and the speed at which the game was completed are primary. If the player died at all, they will not get a good ranking. Lower rankings result in bizarre things happening to Lena, such as her exploding or falling off of the bottom of the screen. [CR]The PC Engine version[CR]The PC Engine version of the game is substantially different from the Super Famicom version. It is the "original" version of the game.A cutscene with Cham.Most noticeably, it contains many animated cutscenes to help tell the story, is fully voiced, and has CD audio. There are also a number of gameplay differences. The game moves at a much slower pace, and Lena is capable of some actions not present in the SFC version: she can slide and has powerful magic (in fact, each character has magic). However, she is incapable of running and does not have the magic bullet and power ups from the SFC version. Her sword strikes shoot crescent arcs when performed, unlike in the SFC version. The game also has multiple playable characters: By hitting the "run" button, the player can switch between Lena, Am, or Asfar. Lastly, the game's stages are quite different, despite some of them using the same or similar sprites. There are also different power ups to be collected. As a side note, the game features numerous bottomless pits, a feature largely absent from the SFC version.ItemsSmall herb: This item restores 2 points of HP.Large herb: This item restores 6 points of HP.Red power: This item raises the character's level, making their attack more powerful and giving them more HP. The maximum number of levels is 5.Blue power: This item adds four points to the magic bar, allowing for more powerful magic. There are three levels of magic.Star: Gives the player temporary invincibility.Time up: Gives the player more time.1 up: Gives the player an additional life.Mysterious item: Resembling a disembodied head of Yuko in her "Ultimate Valis" armor, this item maxes out the player's level and magic.StagesLena vs. Dhalgen.Stage 1: VecantiLena and Am head out to rescue the kidnapped Valna. Cham guides the player through the game's basic controls in a mini-tutorial stage, then the action begins. The boss of this stage is General Dhalgen. His actions are much the same as in the SFC version. Ultra Seven makes a cameo in the background here, fighting a pair of ultra kaiju. One is clearly Twintail, the other is ambiguous.This boss is not in the SFC version. Stage 2: BabylonSimilar to the SFC version, however it is much much longer. Asfar rescues Lena and Am from Galgia at the end of the previous stage, and now joins as a playable character. A number of enemies not present in the SFC version are found in this stage, including a version of lash weilding a flaming whip (probably how it got the name) a cyclops, and a floating energy ball (which does make an appearances in the SFC version, albeit recoloured orange as an attack of General Medius'). The boss of this stage is a disembodied head and pair of hands not found in the SFC version.Stage 3: Road to the heavensContinuing to the heavens to meet Yuko, this stage continues with the look of "Babylon". The boss of this stage is a pegasus knight who transforms in to a harpy for a second form. The harpy sprite is re-used in the SFC version as Nornil's second form.Stage 4: Labyrinth of ShirenMaterial from this stage is used for "Valhalla" in the SFC version. An enemy not in the SFC version is present (a pixie.) The boss is a pair of illusions created by Yuko; one of her goddess self, and one of her old "Soldier of Valis" self.Stage 5: TokyoThe city streets are burning and overrun with monsters from Galgia's army. Freak weather conditions are also apparent. Features a couple of enemies not seen in the SFC version, including a giant worm, a "tower red" and an enhanced version of the spectre. The boss of this stage is DS-30kai. It is substantially more difficult in this game. Unlike in the SFC version where it simply throws scythe blades and floats around, in the PCE version it creates multiple images of itself, teleports, fires skull projectiles and (of course) throws scythe blades and dives at Lena.Stage 6: Inside Crystal PillarThe SFC version looks much the same. This marks the first appearance of the annoying foetus "beyond" in this version of the game. There is yet another variation of the spectre seen in this stage, and a skull ghost that appears in pits to fire projectiles at our heroes. Unlike in the later SFC version, some parts of this stage are "slippery"; because Asfar is so heavy, he doesn't slide around like the girls do. General Medius is the boss of this stage. She flies around the room and teleports periodically; she also fires blue foetuses,destructable blue crystals, and an orange projectile that bounces around the screen at the player.Stage 7: Exterior of Crystal PillarThe heroes must climb the outside of Crystal Pillar to reach the summit. There are a large number of enemies not present in the SFC version in this stage, including dark angels, "gun guarders", and small rods of crystal that open and shoot projectiles. Once again the floors are slippery, and once again Asfar is not affected. There are also special barriers in this stage that Asfar can walk through, as he is a member of the monster race. The stage also features glowing platforms that are only visible part of the time (although they still "exist" even when not visible). Gojira makes a cameo appearance in the background of this stage. The boss of this stage is General Luzard. He simply floats back and forth, firing crystal spikes at the player. The player character Am is lost in this stage.Stage 8: Red MoonThe original version of Red Moon is extremely different from the SFC version. There are a variety of floor types here that move the player character around in different directions, or are simply slippery; Asfar is not affected by these. There are "turret" type enemies that are brains here, not seen in the SFC version. Asfar challenges his son to a duel at the end; most of Galgia's attacks here mimic his father's magic.Stage 9: Red Moon part 2More of the same, except now only Lena is playable. This stage features a couple of mini-bosses. The first is "final guarder", who is destructable in this game (unlike in the SFC version) and the second is a giant, cyclopean brain that fires eyeballs. The foetus bubbles make another appearance, this time reducing Lena's level if they make contact and pop. At the end of the stage, Lena finally fights Galgia. His first form hovers and fires small homing "wolf heads" at Lena; he also drops to the ground and performs clawing attacks (especially if the player has been sliding back and forth under him frequently). His second form is a giant disembodied head and pair of hands. The hands can be destroyed and drop big herbs. The head flies around shooting various projectiles at Lena. From time to time it becomes invincible and careens around wildly. The head has a very large amount of HP. Should the player defeat Galgia, they are rewarded with the (rather gloomy) ending cutscene.[CR]Secrets[CR]The PCE Engine version of Valis IV has two secret stages, both labeled "X" that can be accessed if the game is set to the highest difficulty and the player defeats Galgia, or via using a stage select code: Up, down, left, right, up, down, left, right, up, down, left, right, II, II, I, I.One of the stages is a rather bizarre railway, featuring enemies from other parts of the game on handcars, mine carts, and other silly obstacles. The boss is Zalude from Valis III. He refuses to fight Asfar or Am, resulting in bizarre dialogue from him (he wonders where Cham and Valna are) and a game reset! If he is fought and defeated with Lena Bland, he will send her to stage 5 of the PC Engine version of Valis III. It is extremely difficult and is heavily populated with enemies from other parts of Valis IV. The boss is Zalude again, although he is incredibly difficult this time, utilizing many attacks which are essentially impossible to avoid.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The governing planet of the Vasteel Solar System is called Belose. Emperors of the Faracia dynasty have been ruling the planet for hundreds of years. However, the last emperor turned out to be rather unpopular with the people, and they began talking about changing the government system. Unexpectedly, the emperor becomes gravely ill and dies soon thereafter. His elder son, Faliall, is proclaimed the heir. However, Faliall's younger brother, Stefan, cares for the wishes of the simple folk, and is willing to change things. Hence, the bloody war between the two brothers for power and justice begins...[CR]Vasteel is a hex-based war strategy game in its core. The story mode takes the player (who controls either Stefan's or Faliall's armies) through various top-down maps, on which the two armies will try to annihilate each other, advance to a better position, conquer enemy cities, etc. There is also a versus mode, which allows two-player gameplay, as well as access to all the maps regardless of the story.[CR]The armies of the two princes are entirely robotic; even tanks, cannons, and spaceships are shaped like "transformer" robots. Both armies have factories, which can produce new robots, even several times per turn; each such productions costs money, of which there is limited amount. The player navigates the robots in turn-based fashion over the map. Combat ensues when two robots are on the same grid.[CR]Unlike in most games of this kind, the actual battles in Vasteel are interactive and action-based (real time). The players must quickly move their robots and shoot at each other. Same applies to robots which enter factories and cities with the intention to destroy their protective mechanisms; the defending side uses stationary turrets to fire at the robot, while the latter tries to avoid them and get to the core before being destroyed.</plot>

		<plot>Vasteel 2 is formally a sequel to  Vasteel; it is also set in the eponymous fictional, futuristic solar system and deals primarily with strategic battles between robots. However, its story is not directly connected with that of the predecessor. The main hero is a young boy named Voice Knuckles, who enjoys a peaceful life with his mother and his girlfriend Diggy. But the cruel Emperor Agares attacks his planet and destroys Voice's home, killing his mother in the process. The boy swears revenge. Aided by his girlfriend and his friends, he assembles a rebel army from fighters who navigate giant robots, and is determined to defeat Agares at all costs.[CR]The game is more story-heavy than its predecessor, and has more clearly pronounced anime/manga aesthetics. Animated cut scenes occur between the missions and advance the story. Even during the large strategic battles, characters would often engage in dialogue, and scripted events might occur.[CR]The gameplay also underwent some changes. Vasteel 2 is, like its predecessor, a hex-based, turn-based strategy game with robotic combat; however, the action sequences are gone, and the battles now proceed automatically, as in most games of this genre. Robot production and financial management were also simplified or removed. However, the player can choose to use various types of weapons before engaging an enemy in combat. For example, robots can use melee attacks, bipedal tanks can use different laser beams, etc.</plot>

		<title_clean>Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego</title_clean>
		<plot>Carmen Sandiego is a master thief who leads the criminal organization V.I.L.E. This organization specializes in stealing the world's treasures without a trace. Alarmed by this, the A.C.M.E. Detective Agency makes it their personal mission to foil Carmen Sandiego's plans.[CR]Carmen Sandiego is an game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country. This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away. Along with finding out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members, eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.</plot>

		<title_clean>Wizardry V - Heart of the Maelstrom</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wizardry V is a first-person, grid-based, RPG that stands as a wholly separate adventure without an arc associated with it. After assembling their party of adventurers, the player will confront many challenges and puzzles as they attempt to penetrate the dangers surrounding the so-called Heart of the Maelstrom stirring beneath a fantastic castle. It should not be confused with the Japanese version of the series which had long since spun off from the main franchise. It was published in October, 1992.As in all other Wizardry games, Wizardry V is played from a first person 3D perspective. It would be the last game in the series to feature wire-frame dungeon walls, text-only interface design, and static 2D monster portraits although the visuals would be significantly upgraded for its console release on the SNES. On PCs, however, the various game environments are primarily distinguished from each other by (often quite verbose) text descriptions. Similarly, text messages and non-interactive dialogue sequences are used to advance the plot.The relatively simple and clear interface is organized around a series of commands and actions listed at the bottom of the screen as well as a combined inventory and statistics screen. The original release of the game lacked mouse support but this was later added to subsequent versions.Wizardry V did not offer an import option for characters/parties created in the first four titles.Among the other features of the game were:Over 70 spells were available for casting4 basic classes to choose from and four elite classes to upgrade to5 races to create classes withThe game did not have any copy protection and creating a Scenario Diskette was needed in order the game on. The CD-ROM version of the game automatically circumvented this by creating one on the drive when installed.The manual was also noteworthy for being written in a way that made Wizardry V appear appealing to newcomers with little to no experience with an RPG. Illustrated with humorous drawings and a great deal of detail worked into its text, it also outlined several key monsters/encounters that the party may discover on their trips into the Maze.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Long ages have passed within the Kingdom of Llylgamyn. The evil of Werdna is but legend, the secrets of the Knight of Diamonds long forgotten, and the Mad Overlord has become but a story to scare little children into doing what their parents say. The descendants of the legendary heroes of old have long since disappeared, but the Orb that they had recovered in their last and greatest adventure continues to provide knowledge to those that seek its wisdom. With its revelations on the secrets of life and magic, it spurred much debate and would found a new school of magic organized around what it had shared with those that dared to look into its depths. The Orb was handed to the Brotherhood of Llylgamym for safekeeping and peace reigned throughout the land.But things began to grow dark once more. Strange weather was the first sign, sickness the next. What was happening? People looked to the orb for help, fearing that it had lost its powers. The High Council was called together behind closed doors. Weeks passed, but with the use of powerful magic and the grace of both the ancient and new gods, they found what they were looking for.They discovered that the very fabric of reality was coming apart and that the source of this chaos was an unnatural, magical vortex located beneath the Brotherhood's Temple within a maze of caverns and tunnels. It was a place known as the Maelstrom. It had long been a home to foul beasts and the outcasts of the land and there, a great evil now festered threatening not only the land but the entire world. All that we knew may cease to exist if its growth isn't stopped.They sages of the High Council knew only one answer: to seek the help of a demi-god known as the Gatekeeper. Once a mortal, his power grew to a point where it soon became divine and had inherited the responsibility of watching over and maintaining the balance of magic and the natural world. He might be their only hope, assuming that he would listen to mortals.But the sages were confident that their call would be answered, so grave was the danger. However, to their utter horror, they learned that the Gatekeeper himself was held prisoner in the heart of the very vortex they wished him to destroy! Terrified, the Sages turned ot the Brotherhood whose knowledge of the mystical and magical exceeded their own. Here, a tale of evil and treachery was scried by Brother Drew, High Prophet of the Brotherhood.They learned of a renegade Brother, a woman named the Sorn, whose wish it is to end all order in the universe. She had discovered a means to create an ever-growing rift in reality...the very vortex that now threatens the land. From this destruction will come a new universe where chaos will reign and the world will no longer exist. It was she who trapped the Gatekeeper and made him prisoner. She must be stopped lest everyone perish in her madness.It has been three years since these events were discovered and the vortex continues to grow. Time is growing short. Two of the most powerful sages in the kingdom, Fontizan and the High Sage Yeldarb have begun to seek warriors brave enough to enter the caverns beneath the Temple of the Brotherhood, find the Gatekeeper, and free him from the vortex. However, they must first defeat the evil Sorn.In order to even have a chance, the adventurers must first seek out G'bli Gedook, the High Priest of the Brotherhood. He is the guardian of the Orb of Llylgamym and resides in the first layer of the caverns just under the temple. From there, they must descend into the depths of the Maze and battle whatever the Sorn can conjure up to stop them.After many battles and adventures, a party did achieve the impossible and confronted the Sorn deep below the Temple. By closing the Triaxial Gate which was the source of the rift and calling forth the Gatekeeper, they destroyed the shield that had protected the Sorn and its minions. In the battle that followed, the Sorn was ultimately defeated and the Triaxial Balance restored.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Wizardry V is a tile or grid based movement, first-person RPG set in a mysterious Castle that serves as the base for party management and the Maze in which the adventure takes place. Party size is limited to six members, although smaller parties are even allowed but not suggested for survival. The player must find penetrate the dangers and mysteries of the Maze in order to stop the nefarious Sorn dwelling within the Heart of the Maelstrom. But, in order to do, the party must also negotiate the Maze and deal with its dangerous inhabitants as well as solve the puzzles that stand in their way.The Maze comprises the central theater for the adventure and is comprised of several levels, each with its own distinct dangers and puzzles to solve. The lack of an automap (which had yet to become a standard feature of RPGs at the time of W6's release) means that the player is required to draw his or her own maps or otherwise rely on unofficial game guides and walkthroughs in order to navigate the mazelike multi-level dungeon.Saves could only be made anywhere, but Wizardry V's setup on PCs had an additional side-benefit to doing so. It would allow players to quick-save their progress and quit out of the scenario and if they chose to start at the Castle with a fresh party, they could wander back into the Maze and even encounter their old party where they had left them.Levels were earned after gaining the requisite experience as well as resting at the Inn back at the Castle. It was possible to continue adventuring well after the previous experience limit was met and earning several levels at once after a restful stay at the Inn.The CastleThis was the central location for the player's management options concerning their party. Here, several locations were available by hotkey:Gilgamesh's Tavern - A dim and smoke filled place with a perpetual haunch of boar roasting over the fire, small groups of adventurers congregate here discussing their latest exploits or hoping to join a party. This is where the player will build their party from characters they create.Adventurer's Inn - Rest is offered as long as the party can afford their stay. Several different rooms are provided ranging from the Stables to a Royal Suite, each with their own rate of healing. This is also where resting characters can level up once they have the requisite experience.Temple of Cant - More severe ailments are handled here, again for the right 'donation'. Paralysis, poison, and even the dead can be brought back to a sense of normalcy after enough coins are shared with the faithful. Boltac's Trading Post - A friendly dwarf named Boltac operates this in the Castle's market area, providing his services to anyone that can afford them. Arms, goods, and even his experience in identifying certain items can all be purchased with the right coin. The party can even sell their ill gotten gains here to free up their pockets for even more loot that they might come across. Boltac can even remove cursed items, although the party will also lose the item once it's "uncursed."Edge of Town - From here, the party can visit the Training Grounds, enter the Maze, or head back to the Castle.The Maze - Many adventurers seeking fame, glory, and experience eagerly dive into the dangers of the Maze. Other adventurers, monsters, and even a few riddles await them here as they head ever deeper into the depths in search of evil.Training Grounds - New characters are created here and players can also inspect older characters to see if they need a few changes of their own.Character InteractionNot every monster wants to stick the party's heads on a pike and some might even be very helpful. When these NPCs (non-player characters) are encountered, the party have several options that they can explore. They can talk to them which brings up a text parser for inquiries to made with, similar to that found in interactive fiction.The player can also barter with them if they have anything to sell, or if they want to buy something from the party. The party can also opt to give them something for free in order to get onto their good side. Stealing is also another option and a charm spell can also be cast to help them see the party in a better light. Or, if the player wants, they can just opt to fight and kill whoever they had been having a nice conversation with. The player just needs be sure they can live with the consequences, or have enough coin to resurrect them with once they've had their fun.PuzzlesWizardry V's puzzles were focused primarily around riddles and items that were needed to get by certain obstacles. Most notable was its maze-like dungeon with many random encounters thrown in for good measure.Picking Locks and Disarming TrapsPicking locks was as simple as having a Thief (or a mage with the proper spell) in the party to do so depending on their expertise. Disarming traps, especially on treasure chests, was much more different. A character with the proper skill could inspect the chest and determine what kind of trap was on it. Once they made their assessment, it was up to the player to disarm the trap by opting to do so and then typing the trap's name in. If they are correct, the trap is disarmed.CampingThis command allowed the party to camp out in the middle of the dungeon. This also enabled the player to inspect their party members and also re-order their party's marching order. This also allows the player to equip their entire party at once if they so choose.SwimmingThere are magical pools that the party can dive into in order to discover anything of worth within their depths. Characters will learn the art of swimming over time and with enough experience in diving into pools.[CR]Special Monsters[CR]Wizardy V also came with a pamphlet outlining several special encounters within the Maze complete with illustrations showing what they looked like. These NPCs could provide the player with clues, special items, or simply challenge the party with death.IronoseHe operates the local Maze Mart. He can be found bartering his goods, buying others gems, and battling an adventurer or two on the first level of the Maelstrom. He boasts "The Best Dungeon Prices" and comes in handy to adventurers in need. He determined that there was a place for a "Shop" in the Maze and that's where it first began. Business was slow at first, he only sold a few potions to Ice Phantoms and weapons to fighters, but gradually through word of mouth and an intense grafitti effort, business picked up. He's a well trained fighter, but friendly. After all, the customer is always right (well, most of the time!).The Laughing KettleBelieve it or not, there's actually a land where Kettles roam freely (if that's what Kettles do), the motherland of Fymia. It is the origin of The Laughing Kettle.Back in his homeland, he was well-educated, respected and loved. However, tension eventually grew as the Kettle began to spout information no one understood time after time. His one-time friends talked behind his back; "He thinks he knows it all!" Actually, the Kettle was only trying to help them. The taunting continued, and he decided he had heard enough. It was time to leave this blessed soil to head for the Maelstrom... with a bang. And a bang it was! Granted, it wasn't the right thing to do. No one remained. He laughs today at this event, and likely will laugh tomorrow.The Kettle has been around the Maelstrom for years, and despite his laughter, his wisdom is great. He's still your everyday "know-it-all." Manfretti's "Adventure getting you down? Combat's just not going as well as you had planned? Come to Manfretti's, the fun center of the Maelstrom." That's what the graffiti said. But there is more to Manfretti's, both in fun and in lore, than meets the eye.There you'll find things to delight your senses, thrill your spirit, and warm your heart. It was all created for you by the magical Manfretti, a man who had a love for life and a first-rate sense of humor. He realized that once in awhile even the best needed a break, and so he and a group of his female associates carved from the rock within the Maze until he had created room for his fun center. It took the Manfretti and the five women years of work. When they finished, Manfretti smiled at their achievements and planned for more.Saying good-bye to the ladies, off he went in search of more "fun things to do." Time went by, but he never returned, and to this day, Manfretti's whereabouts are unknown. Yet the ladies he left behind continue on his dream; they keep the fun center alive, all the while hoping for his return. When you visit, and I am sure you will, you may meet one of them, and you should meet all. Ye Dragon's Flagon If only these walls could talk, what a story they would tell. From far and near, the weary, dwarf fighters who inhabit the Maze come to the Dragon's Flagon in search of the three R's: rest, relaxation and rye.It's truly an interesting place. Somehow those little fingers have managed to disguise the bar. You won't find it... ever; it's their private reserve (with all profits channelled back to the five dwarfs in the Flagon's membership, of course). It was established in 674 b.m. (before Maelstrom) to honor the much beloved and huge Dragon of Bhjimo, who carried her likewise huge flagon everywhere. After her death at the hand of Yetteje, a robust samurai, the dwarf fighters dragged the flagon to its current, undisclosed location.Should you happen upon this place, you can almost always find one of the dwarfs willing to talk if you've got the ear to listen. They have been around the maze, and might be able to offer something of value. But occasionally, adventure calls the dwarf fighters, so be prepared to make several return visits.The Togo Llama No one can pass up a gaze at this breathtaking creature. Imagine a llama in a toga. It's not an everyday sight, nor is this an everyday animal.Many, many years ago a clan of llamas roamed the plains of Lytricidickydo. The plains were sizzling hot, but the llamas had adapted to this environment fairly well. Then one day an adventurer by the name of Nalla Orman came along, bartering his goods."I have here the most wondeful item. It's something you need to stop that blasted heat. I'll sell you this exclusive designer toga for only 5000 gold pieces. You won't find another one like it anywhere!"And so he went on... and on... and on. Eventually the llamas bought his story and his togas. Whether they did it just to shut him up, no one knows. Nonetheless, they followed him back to the Castle and into the dungeons where the air was cool and the living was easy. Hence is the story of the Toga Llama.The Ruby WarlockThe lore of the Ruby Warlock goes back quite a ways. It seems he's been around forever. In his younger years, he was quite a gem. He practiced spells every day, and looked forward to the time when he, like those before him, could walk the lower levels proud and unafraid. However, the spirits got him. Bottled spirits, that is. He can be seen asking passers-by for a sip. Of course, the creatures of the Maze look upon The Ruby Warlock with pity, and help him when they can. He's not really a bad fellow, just a Warlock who fell by the wayside.He still remains a fairly laid-back individual, unless provoked. As "Warlock" would imply, he is chock-full of magical power! So take care in your words and your actions.The Ghosts' Nest So you've never seen a ghost. You will likely see one of yourself if you're not careful. Yes, this is the legendary Ghosts' Nest, home to those who have refused to accept the fact that... well... they are dead.The whereabouts of this dwelling are unknown, even to me. But I have been told on more than one occasion that it is not a place for the meek. Even the strongest, they say, will perish underneath the vapory fingers of its inhabitants. Unfortunately, it's likely that there is a ghost on duty at all times, so a "pleasure stroll" is out of the question.I found once an old scroll in the dust of the Maze; I know not why I tell you. It may be of no matter. The parchment was badly soiled, and the words were nearly gone. I could decipher part of its tale: "Death awaits, gold comes, terror abounds... from the three, straight to thee..." The Den of Thieves Banned from virtually every corner of the Maelstrom is the troop of bandits who shelter at the Den of Thieves. The poor souls are misunderstood outcasts in their own Maze. They're really a nice crew (as long as you keep your stuff secure). However, they are a bit hard to find.Throughout the years they've managed to assemble a lot of items stolen from various, fool-hearty adventurers. Swords, shields, bows, potions... you name it. Naturally, in order to protect themselves, they needed a good hiding spot. Three of the thieves were certain that a room deep within the caverns would be the perfect spot. However, another member of their guild reminded the ambitious members that monsters (and he meant monsters) lived in those depths. Finally, the wisest of them all announced his plan to the agreement of the rest. The Den was to be established in an area where no light shown. It was hoped you would never find the door.Try, hard, adventurer! For as they pick your pockets, you can pick their minds. As sneaky as they are, a word or two not meant for their ears may have been heard. Check in on them often for the latest gossip. The Hurkle Beast Lurking and stalking, working and talking are the traits of the infamous Hurkle Beast. He is the last of the Hurkeniskon species, all of whom "hurkle" often. If you should hear the chant while traversing the caverns, it's likely this chap is nearby.A few brave adventures of times past captured the Hurkle Beast and encaged him in a box. None thought his escape was possible. However, the box proved too weak for the creature, and his breakout was natural. In tatters, the cage still remains, but the Hurkle Beast roams free.Unfortunately, the Hurkle Beast can't figure out how to leave the area to return to his homeland, Hurkazownia. So, here he remains.The SnatchThe Snatch is a crafty little thief who hangs out at Manfretti's. As with most thieves, The Snatch has overheard many conversations. And, like those in his profession, he can't keep a secret very well.The Snatch began his career rather slowly, but then inspiration struck. He applied for membership at the Den of Thieves. Virtually a novice in his profession, he hoped that the members would teach him a thing or two. If not, he'd simply take it. Within two weeks, his application had been unanimously DENIED. He passed none of the stealing tests and got caught three times attempting to steal information. Yet, he passed the important tests; that is, those tests important to The Snatch! He stole "The Thieves Handbook" from the Den, the member's ideas and their trade secrets to boot. He never wanted membership; he only wanted all they had to give.GwylionThey never intended to be the way they are. Not so long ago, they were friendly, light-hearted individuals. Now, they roam the Maze, bent on the revenge of an unknown cause. Everyone who greets them is subjected to attack and only rarely will they offer the party a truce.The story of their transformation is unknown, but the Gwylion's change occurred shortly after it was declared that Manfretti was missing. Some speculate that the girls loved Manfretti; others, such as I, believe it was jealousy of those who enjoyed his company. When Manfretti was around, they would listen to his jokes and stories for hours on end. After his disappearance, their visits lessened, and gradually ended. They may still search for him today.Feel sorrow for these poor beasts, but not enough to render yourself open to their attacks. Surely, they will show you no mercy. [CR]Character Development[CR]The player can opt to start with the batch of pre-made character provided for them by the game or create their own.AgeCharacters can actually age in Wizardry V if they rest too much. Resting at the Inn can last anywhere from a single day to a year depending on how much gold the player has in reserve. Resting replenishes a party's health and stamina, readying them for the road ahead, but rest enough times and a character will start to age. But when they first start out in the game, they are at an extremely young age. Death by old age is hardly expected, but it is a possibility.ClassesThe character classes belong to one of two categories; Base or Elite. Base classes (Fighter, Mage, Priest, Thief) are often considered the 'starting' class for a character whereas Elite classes (Lord, Bishop, Samurai, Lord, Ninja) typically benefit from having better fighting skills and eventual proficiency in magic. The initial statistics requirements for Elite classes are noticably higher than for the Base classes, making the former much more difficult to create at the start of the game.As with quite a few RPGs, Wizardry V includes the option to change character class during the course of the game at the Training Grounds when inspecting a character. The incentives to do so in Wizardry V are comparatively strong as many abilities are retained from the original classes, and since characters who recently changed classes during mid-game can often gain levels rapidly (thus enabling the player to raise skill points and fill out spell books much faster than would otherwise have been possibly).Alignment largely determines what kind of class a particular character can be.The four basic classes are:Fighter - High hit points and experts at using any weapon and piece of armor, they are a grounded class that can dish out the damage as well as take it.Thief - No party is complete without a thief who can pick locks and disarm traps. While they aren't the greatest of fighters, they rely on their sneakiness to backstab their enemies.Priest - Long known as skilled healers, their talents are important for any party heading out into danger. They can also dispel the undead. They cannot be of neutral alignment.Mage - The classic wizard. As they become more powerful, their spellbooks will continue to add many new pages filled with deadly spells. The four elite classes are: Bishop - Like a Priest, they are able to heal their friends and dispel the undead. They are also able to uncurse items that become permanently stuck to a character, freeing them. They can also learn any spell from any of the other schools. The downside is that their learning rate is also a bit slower, so the selection of spells that they may have will take more time to develop. But with their uncurse ability, they're nigh indispensible. They must not be neutral.Samurai - A true swordsman. At the fourth level of experience, they begin to learn Mage spells. They cannot be of evil alignment because of their adherence to the code of Bushido.Lord - Skilled as a fighter as well as being pious enough to cast a few spells, they are likened to paladins and crusader knights. They start learning priestly spells around the fourth level of experience. They can also only be of good alignment.Ninja - An assassin and a rogue, they can kill with weapons or their bare hands, sometimes being able to kill the strongest enemy with a single blow. They disdain armor and become far harder to hit and tougher to kill as they gain levels. They also have all of the skills of thief and are able to disarm traps. They can also hide in shadows and ambush enemies. They must also be of evil alignment.RacesThe races include familiar fantasy characters such as the Elf, the Dwarf, the Gnome and the Hobbit.Humans - Balanced without any serious flaws, a good, even keeled race that can belong and excel at any profession.Elf - They excel at the intellectual classes, such as Mages, or Bishops. Keenly interested in study.Dwarf - Gruff, short in stature, but tough and reliable, dwarves make excellent Fighters while their piety can also find them a career as a Priest.Gnomes - Found underground and often overlooked by the larger races, their quiet and studious nature make them ideal as Mages or Priests.Hobbit - Friendly, nimble, and otherwise unassuming, they make surprisingly decent Ninja, Samurai, or Thieves.StatisticsAttribute scores had a maximum value of 18 and determined a variety of effects and class eligibility requirements. Many of these attributes were particularly important across many classes across a variety of skills. Characters can improve their attributes thanks to the investment of points earned with every level.Strength - Determines how much damage a character can lay into a monster as well as how much weight they can carry around with them. It also affects certain weapon skills and plays into staminaI.Q. - Important for spellcasters.Piety - This is important for a character's ability to concentrate on the task at hand. It also affects how many spells a character may be able to learn and their effectiveness with them.Vitality - Very important for hit points, the chance for resurrection, the ability to resist damage and disease, and general health.Luck - Ambiguous but it also has mysterious effects on many other factorsAs with many RPGs, character development was driven by experience points which translated into levels. When a character gains a level after resting an an inn:Spellcasters may be able to learn a new spellDepending on their statistics, a character may even change their classHit points will also improve[CR]Combat[CR]Combat in Wizardry V was a turn based affair with random encounters providing the cannon fodder that would feed the party's thirst for experience points. When enemies encountered the party, a list of enemies along with a picture showing what they were onscreen.Similar to other RPGs of the era, its strict turn-based system halts the passage of time until the player performs an action (such as moving around or casting spells). In combat, the order in which characters act is determined primarily by their speed statistics, although the player issues orders to every character in the party before commencing a turn. Besides using melee and/or ranged weapons and casting spells, characters with the appropriate skills can hide (which means enemies cannot hurt them), use items in their inventory, equip new weapons or items or try to run away from battle which, if successful, results in the entire party fleeing from the enemies. It is not possible to save the game or restore a saved game while in combat mode, but there are no other restrictions on when and where the player can save the game.In each round of combat, everyone makes their selection of actions as the game calculates who will have initiative and then executing their orders. When several groups of monsters are encountered, the player is able to pick out who the targets are from the generated list shown onscreen.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The FM Towns version featured enhanced CD quality music.By this point, the Wizardry series was so popular in Japan, an anime spin-off was created.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]World Heroes 2 is a 2D fighting game developed by  ADK and published by  SNK for the  Neo Geo. It is a direct sequel to  World Heroes, adding six new playable characters and one new boss. Death Match mode from the previous game received an overhaul, adding and removing obstacles (mine fields, moving saws, laser beams, slippery floors, and smaller arenas) while completely changing the lifebar system to one large tug-of-war lifebar. Gameplay additions include taunting (standing far back while pressing the throw button), throw reversals (throwing at the moment you're being grabbed, can cause "throw battles") and projectile reflection (blocking at the very moment a projectile reaches you, similar to the  Just Defend system of  Garou: Mark of the Wolves). The game was ported to the  SNES and  TurboGrafx CD by  Takara. The original version of the game was released on the  Neo Geo CD with an arranged soundtrack and released on the  World Heroes Anthology compilation for the  PlayStation 2.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] Hanzo (based on Hanzo Hattori) Fuuma (based on Fuma Kotaro) Kim Dragon (based on  Bruce Lee) Janne D'Arc (based on  Joan of Arc) Julius Carn (based on  Genghis Khan) Muscle Power (based on  Hulk Hogan) Brocken Rasputin (based on Grigori Rasputin) Mudman Ryoko Izumo (based on Ryoko Tani) Captain Kidd (based on William Kidd) Erick (based on Erik the Red) Johnny Maximum Shura (based on Nai Khanom Tom)Neo Geegus (boss, based on  T-1000) Dio (boss)[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The great hero Latok, the descendant of the war god Duel, has returned to his hometown Fearless, where he lives peacefully with his mother. But one day, a messenger brings terrible news: the castle of Farland was attacked, the king, the princess, and countless soldiers brutally slain. Zomu Dizae, the third and the final demon commander of the dark world Zekisis (Latok has defeated the other two, Badou and Gospel), has arrived. He is aided by the treacherous Necromancer, who turned the soldiers of Farland into monsters. Will Latok be able to defeat the evil once again?[CR]Xak III: The Eternal Recurrence is an action RPG, similar in gameplay style to its  predecessors, but also incorporating some elements first introduced in  Tower of Gazel, such as the ability to jump and having companions (although this feature is much more limited here). Jumping ability is crucial in many cases, as there are obstacles that can only be avoided by jumping over them. Latok starts at level 50, but still can gain experience points and become stronger. A new (and very useful) feature is hit points restoration, which occurs when Latok is standing still. To counter that, enemies can re-spawn, which means that there aren't many completely safe areas in the game.</plot>

		<plot>Based on the manga Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl, the game follows the story of Yawara Inokuma, the teenage granddaughter of a famous judo master. While she is trying to have an ordinary life, her grandfather insists on her studying the martial art of judo, and she has troubles to decide what her goal in life is going to be. The game's protagonist is one of the minor characters in the manga, a young journalist named Matsuda. Seeing how Yawara effortlessly beats up an assailant on the street, Matsuda decides to find out who the "wonder girl" is, feeling that she is going to become a famous sports star.[CR]The game is what is commonly known as digital comic, i.e. Japanese-style adventure game without puzzles and with very limited, basic interaction possibilities. Typically, the player is presented with a few verb commands and object sub-menus at every screen, and has to go through them in order to make progress. Animated and voiced cut scenes frequently occur in order to advance the narrative.</plot>

		<title_clean>Yamamura Misa Suspense - Kinsenka Kyouezara Satsujin Jiken</title_clean>
		<plot>Kinsenka Ky&#333; Ezara Satsujin Jiken is based on a series on a series of novels by the Japanese detective fiction author Misa Yamamura. The popular protagonist of the novels, inspector S&#333;suke Kariya, appears in the game as one of the characters; but the main heroine and the player character is Yuko Kobayakawa, a journalist working for a gourmet magazine. During a trip to Kyoto she attends a party and witnesses a mysterious murder of a wealthy man's estranged wife. Yoko decides to stay and help the authorities investigate the crime.The game plays like a puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure. Most of the time the player chooses a location to travel to and interrogates characters, selecting various topics from a list. Such scenes are presented in first-person view. A few segments, however, feature third-person navigation with point-and-click interaction, similar to Western adventures. Other instances require the player to move a cursor on a zoomed object to interact with it in a detailed way.</plot>

		<title_clean>Yokoyama Mitsuteru Shin Sangokushi - Tenka wa Ware ni</title_clean>
		<plot>Tenka wa Ware ni is based on the Sangokushi manga by Mitsuteru Yokoyama, itself an adaptation of Eiji Yoshikawa's re-telling of the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. As such, the game includes plot elements and a few characters added by Yoshikawa or Yokoyama, but for the most part remains faithful to the general storyline of the Chinese novel and hence to the actual historical events of the Three Kingdoms Era.The gameplay is similar to that of Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, focusing on grand strategy and country management as well as on tactical battles. There is no scenario selection, but the player can choose between multiple warlords of the three kingdoms. The player then manages the province under control of the selected warlord. It is necessary to take care of the population and army, buying provisions, training officers, and publishing edicts. Diplomacy plays an important role: pacts and agreements can be made, and it is also possible to acquire new allies through various means.Invading (or being attacked by) another country leads to a large-scale tactical battle that takes place on hexagonal grids. The player navigates army divisions in turn-based fashion. Contact with an enemy division leads to yet another sub-mode, where the player controls units that form the division, positioning and navigating them on a smaller battle screen. The game also has a separate battle mode accessible from the main menu, where the player can recreate historical battles directly without going through grand strategy portions.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ys Book I and II is a compilation of the games Ys: Ancient Ys Vanished and Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished - The Final Chapter. It was one of the first video games to use CD-ROM, which was utilized to provide enhancements such as improved graphics, a longer quest, a CD-quality Redbook audio soundtrack, cinematic anime cutscenes, and extensive voice acting throughout the game. The game's English localization was also one of the first to use voice dubbing. When it released in 1989, the game was regarded as a technical marvel, showcasing the possibilities of the CD-ROM format.It was the second role-playing game released on the CD-ROM format, six months after Tengai Maky&#333;: Ziria. Ys I &amp; II was also the first action RPG released on CD-ROM, and the first CD-ROM based RPG released in North America. The game was critically acclaimed upon release for being one of the first games to effectively demonstrate the potential of the CD-ROM format, including a lengthy adventure, animated cut scenes, and a soundtrack featuring Red Book music and voiced dialogues.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Ys Book ISee Ys: The Vanished OmensYs Book IISee  Ys II: The Final Chapter[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is fairly straightforward. There is no "attack' button. The player simply runs into the enemies to slash them with Adol's sword. The armor Adol wore, his level, and the angle at which the player attacked determines the success of the attack. Also, some enemies have a higher defense versus physical attacks and can only be defeated with certain items or magic.[CR]Differences From Prior Releases[CR]The music in the TG-CD release of the game is by far the biggest difference to prior releases. The graphics were updated a little and there was voice acting as well.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The game was widely acclaimed by critics upon release. In Japan, Famitsu's panel of four reviewers gave the game scores of 9, 9, 9, and 8, out of 10, adding up to an overall score of 35 out of 40.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ys III: Wanderers From Ys is the third entry in the Ys series. Taking place nearly three years after the events in Ys I &amp; II, Adol and his companion, Dogi, have been wandering the land. On their journey, the two had heard rumors regarding Dogi's hometown, Redmont, that prompted them to venture there. Dogi's hometown, located in the land of Felghana, had been experiencing crop failure as well as vicious nighttime attacks. Not afraid of the danger, Adol and Dogi set forth on their new adventure.Ys III, like its predecessors, was originally released on the NEC PC-8801 and its upgraded version PC-9801 in 1989. It was soon ported to other Japanese home computers, like the MSX and Sharp X68000. A couple of years later, it was ported to the SNES, Genesis and TurboGrafx-CD. These console ports all received English localizations.Ys III would be remade as Ys: The Oath in Felghana for the PC in 2005. It follows the same story, but uses the engine from Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim. Its PSP and 2012 Steam re-release versions were localized into English by XSEED.When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded scores of 7,8,7,8 saying, "...misses the high mark of the original. There is little or no challenge here and the whole quest is too straightforward for an adventure game".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ys III features several new additions to the Ys series, while also retaining several components. The most important change comes in the form of it's gameplay. No longer played from a top-down perspective, Ys III is played from a side-scrolling perspective not unlike another Falcom-developed title, Sorcerian. With a change in perspective also comes a change in game mechanics. Players now have direct control over Adol's ability to attack, either with ducking, forward, or overhead sword attacks, which is a major departure from the previous game. In Ys I &amp; II, players had to come in contact with enemies in order to damage them, as the majority of attacks were done automatically. Only in Ys II did players have a controllable attack in the form of a fireball. Another major change is the ability to jump. Since Ys III is also a platformer, the game has been given vertical depth, and as such, Adol needs the ability to jump to attack certain enemies and overcome obstacles. Yet another change to the gameplay system is the omission of magic points. Replaced by consumable rings, players can accrue a stock of them by defeating enemies, and subsequently use them to power the different permanent rings that Adol finds over the course of his adventure. Also of note, is that Ys III does not feature as much back-tracking as it's predecessors, and is much shorter in length because of it.As for the components that Ys III kept, the first would be the wearable rings. Found at various points in the game, Adol can obtain five different rings - power, shield, time, heal, and protection - that have the same properties as they did in the previous games. Adol must also buy or find the different swords, shields, and armors throughout the game, with five items per category just like the previous games. In addition to Adol's equipment, he must also find an array of items, keys, and objects to aid him in his journey and to open up new paths. Ys III also has an experience point system like the previous games, however, depending on the version played, the game will either feature diminishing experience points ( TGCD) or not ( SNES). Ys III also allows players to save at any time they wish, except during boss fights.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys is an action role playing game developed by Hudson Soft for the PC Engine CD system and released in June 1993. While Dawn of Ys shares the same basic story outline as Ys IV: Mask of the Sun and Ys IV: Mask of the Sun - A New Theory, the game is substantially different in all other regards. As such, it is not considered to be part of the official Ys canon, though it maintains a strongly favorable reputation amongst fans of the series in comparison to the other games released as Ys IV.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game takes place two years after the events of Ys II and a year prior to Ys III: Wanders From Ys and begins with Adol and Dogi arriving in the port of Minea. Adol learns from the fortune teller, Sara, of trouble forming in the land of Selceta.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]After the criticisms of the third game's side scrolling nature, both Ys IV: Dawn of Ys and Ys IV: Mask of the Sun return to the top down gameplay of the first two games. Unlike other action/adventure RPGs, combat is handled by running into enemies; there is no attack button. If the enemy is attacked head on then the player takes damage, but if the player is offset so as to hit just one half of the enemy then the enemy will take the damage. This results in a much faster gameplay experience than traditional hack and slash action RPGs, especially given Adol's relatively quick movement speed.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Adol ChristinDogiLeezaKarnaLeezaEldeelGadisBamiGuruda[CR]Fan Translation[CR]Unlike the rest of the Ys series on the TurboGrafx-16 Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys was not released outside of Japan. In 2004 Nick Livaditis (NightWolve) along with a team of hackers and translators created an English patch for Ys IV. All the in-game text was translated however all the voiced cut-scenes remained in Japanese and adding subtitles to the game was impossible. Several people attempted to create a fandub for Dawn of Ys' cut-scenes (one in 2004 and another in 2009) but none of them were finished due to lack of auditions or other problems. A third fandub project was started by Burnt Lasagna which was fully cast, recorded, and released on September 24, 2012.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Kagero no Toki follows  Yasha Enbukyoku as the next game in the  Zan series. [CR]Unlike the previous game, Kagero no Toki contains no supernatural forces (demons), and instead focuses on concrete events of the Sengoku period in Japan, more exactly 16th century, a period of Japanese history that was marked by continuous wars and famous leaders such as Oda Nobunaga or Tokugawa Ieyasu.[CR]The game offers more strategic possibilities than the previous installments of the series. Choosing a region of Japan and its leader, the player can perform a variety of activities, both in his country and towards other leaders. Diplomacy includes negotiation, signing contracts and peace treaties, etc. [CR]Battles are also more in-depth than before; instead of semi-automatic encounters battles occur on a separate map, on which the player has to actively navigate his unit, before he engages the enemy in close combat.</plot>

		<title_clean>Zero 4 Champ II</title_clean>
		<plot>Zero4 Champ II is a sequel to Zero4 Champ. This time, a young Japanese street racer has been defeated by an American who claims that Japan's level is not up to par. His feelings hurt, the youth ventures to the United States, trying to earn enough money and participate in races to defend his national pride.The game is very similar to its predecessor in concept, but offers additional options in the story mode. Part-time jobs now include delivery assignments that play like overhead racing games, as well as tending to dogs of various breeds for money. The security guard assignment plays like a mini-RPG, complete with turn-based combat, experience points, and levels. In addition, it is possible to visit racing tracks and bet money on participants. The versus mode allows players to choose between three courses to compete in, racing against each other (in a top-down mode) or computer AI (first-person).</plot>
