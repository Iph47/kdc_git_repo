		<emu_comment>No Intro Atari 2600 list.[CR]The Atari 2600, or Atari VCS before 1982, is a home video game console released on September 11, 1977 by Atari, Inc. It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F game console.[CR]The console was originally sold as the Atari VCS, which stood for Video Computer System. Following the release of the Atari 5200 in 1982, the VCS was renamed to the "Atari 2600", after the unit's Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge, initially Combat, and later Pac-Man.[CR]Developer:  Atari[CR]Manufacturer:  Atari[CR]CPU:  MOS Technology 6507[CR]Memory:  128 bytes RAM[CR]Graphics:  128-color palette[CR]Sound:  Television Interface Adaptor[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max.

    <plot>PEACE THROUGH SUPERIOR FIREPOWER! [CR]In the far future, the planet is overrun with enormous, super insects, who fiercely battle each other for survival. You've chosen a side to fight for, and the enemy has been funneled into a deep crevice, but now you're outnumbered. You put their numbers to the test. They say the meek shall inherit the Earth, but how long can you defend it?[CR]This was originally planned to be 1 of 3 "3-D" games on Power-Play Arcade cart #1. A screenshot was shown in a catalog for Amiga's Power System, but no description was included. It was programmed by Dan McElroy and Jerry Lawson in 1983, shelved, and made available for limited release in 2010.</plot>

    <plot>The game is similar to the traditional game of tic-tac-toe, but is played on four 4×4 grids stacked vertically; it is basically a computerized version of the board game Qubic using traditional tic-tac-toe notation and layout. To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight possible ways to win on a standard 3×3 board. The game has nine variations: it can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the standard joystick controller.</plot>

    <plot>A falling block game similar to Columns. The object of the game is to create a horizontal or vertical line of three or more blocks of the same color, which will then disappear. The remaining blocks will fall down, but won't disappear if they form another line. Every 10,000 points a special block will appear (the Acid Drop) which removes three columns of blocks and marks the beginning of the next level. This was the last OFFICIAL Atari 2600 commercial game</plot>

    <plot>In 1984, Rob Fulop began work on what would be his last game for the Atari 2600, a 'robot programming' game entitled "Actionauts". Due to the market conditions for Atari 2600 cartridges at the time, Actionauts was never completed, and was not shown or released to the gaming public until 2008.[CR]The original, seemingly simple puzzle-game challenges a single player to use the program editor to construct a sequence of commands to navigate an onscreen robot to reach the 'cheese'. It's not nearly as easy as it looks!</plot>

    <plot>An evil magician has stolen the Enchanted Chalice and has hidden it somewhere in the Kingdom. The object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place it inside the Golden Castle where it belongs. [CR]This is no easy task, as the Evil Magician has created three Dragons to hinder you in your quest for the Golden Chalice. There is Yorgie, the Yellow Dragon, who is just plain mean; there is Grundle, the Green Dragon, who is mean and ferocious; and there is Rhindle, the Red Dragon, who is the most ferocious of all. Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.[CR]There are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and the Golden Castle. Each castle has a Gate over the entrance. The Gate can be opened with the corresponding colored Key. Inside each Castle are rooms(or dungeons, depending at which Skill Level you are playing).[CR]The Castles are separated by rooms, pathways, and labyrinths. Common to all the Skill Levels is the Blue Labyrinth through which you must find your way to the Black Castle. Skill Levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated Kingdom[CR]Adventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Adventure creator Warren Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.</plot>

    <plot>Adventures of TRON is based on the motion picture TRON from Walt Disney Productions. The game was released in Europe after the Walt Disney license expired as "Adventures on GX-12".[CR]The game environment consists of 4 floors, each with flying "bits" as well as enemy MCP attackers. The objective of the game is to control TRON (you) in a maze of platforms and elevators while trying to intercept the flying bits (intercepting bits on higher floors are awarded higher points).[CR]Dodge enemy MCP attackers by jumping, using elevators and hitching a ride on the Silver Sailor. Capturing all 7 "bits" will take you to the next level, with added speed and difficulty.</plot>

    <plot>The object of this game is to defend the buildings at the bottom of the screen.[CR]There are four types of attacking ships moving down the screen. You are moving just above the buildings. The enemies are dropping bombs to try to damage your buildings or destroy you. You must fire missiles up to destroy them. The waves of enemies never ends.[CR]The game ends when all three of your ships are destroyed or when both buildings have taken so much damage that they collapse.[CR]There are eight game variations. Some where the ships move side-to-side while moving down, some where your shots move to the side when you do, some faster and some with combinations of any or all of these.</plot>

    <plot>The player is trapped in a crashed nuclear submarine which has begun taking on water. They need to escape by making their way up the levels of the submarine one at a time. Each floor has two hatch keys that need to be collected in order to unlock the elevator to the next level. There is a time limit, though; if you take too long the floor will flood and you'll be unable to escape. Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes. The player will need to jump over any torpedoes that cross their path, or they will be stunned momentarily and lose precious time.</plot>

    <plot>In this game, based loosely on the movie of the same name, the player moves through a maze (the halls of your ship, according to the game's manual), à la Pac-Man, collecting dots (destroying alien eggs).[CR]If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.[CR]A bonus item occasionally appears.[CR]After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway. You do not lose a life if you fail, but you only have eight seconds to reach the prize before you are off the the next, harder level.</plot>

    <plot>Androman was a small white robot that would scurry about on a floor mat while the player controlled him using the Atari 2600.  Androman also had a barcode scanner in his bottom that would read barcodes placed on the map so the 2600 (and the robot) knew where he was.  Using a combination of the joystick and barcodes, the player could guide Androman around the floor mat and play various games.  One of those games being Androman on the Moon.</plot>

    <plot>Aquaventure is a bit of a mystery in the prototype world. It was never mentioned in any Atari press releases nor does it show up on any internal part lists.  Aquaventure seems to have popped out of the woodwork one day without any public fanfare nor any history behind its mysterious origins.  In any case, Aquaventure seems to be complete and ready for release, we can only speculate as to why it was shelved.</plot>

    <plot>A mothership drops aliens, up to three on screen at a time. There are ten per level. You must shoot them but avoid the items they fire at you. You fire by pushing up on the joystick. Pushing left or right makes you go left or right. If you hold down the button, pushing left or right makes you fire left or right.[CR]Later enemies will drop fireballs that chase you along the ground or split in two smaller enemies when shot. If you fire non-stop, you will build up heat as indicated by the green bar at the bottom right.[CR]If you overheat or are hit by an enemy, you loser a life. The game is over when you lose all lives or reach a score of 999,999. You get a new man (4 max) every 10,000 points.</plot>

    <plot>The objective of Asteroids is to score as many points as possible by destroying asteroids and flying saucers. The player controls a triangular-shaped ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. As the ship moves, momentum is not conserved — the ship eventually comes to a stop again when not thrusting. The player can also send their ship into hyperspace, causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen (with the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid).</plot>

Atlantis II is an altered version of Atlantis When Imagic ran the Defend Atlantis contest, they wanted to find the top four highest-scoring players and invite them to Bermuda for a grand finale shoot-out for cash prizes. The top two-hundred fifty contestants would get snorkeling sets and the top one-thousand contestants would get t-shirts. Unfortunately, more than four people maxed out the score on Atlantis so, to break this tie, all of these maxed-out scorers were sent snorkeling sets and t-shirts as well as a modified Atlantis game called Atlantis II. The modified game is faster, scores lower per hit and the score font is different.</plot>

BASIC Programming for the Atari 2600 makes programming, well, basic.[CR]BASIC is an acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. In conjunction with the manual, this cartridge will help you learn the beginning steps of this easy-to-learn computer language. You can create simple programs, games, and even compose your own music. Up to nine lines of code are allowed.[CR]To simplify the input of data, BASIC Programming requires a set of special keyboard controllers that plug into both the left and right joystick ports. These keyboard controllers were included in the original packaging.</plot>

Start with a Half Pipe that takes you so high you won't know whether you're coming or going. Then do a Quarter Pipe that makes doing dozens of tricks easy and crashing even easier. Then try the Ramp Jump. It's the jump that's just a bit wider than the Grand Canyon. If there's a more dangerous challenge open to daredevil BMX bikers, we have yet to test it. So, if you think you're good - really good - put your freewheeling skills on the line with BMX AirMaster!</plot>

    <plot>In Barnstorming, you are the pilot of a biplane. Your point of view is from the side as the screen scrolls by horizontally. Your goal is to fly through a set number of barns in the shortest amount of time possible. Several obstacles will appear in your way, including flocks of geese, windmills, and weather vanes. Crashing into any of these will cause you to lose speed which will increase your overall time. There are several difficulty levels included which will require that you fly through anywhere from 10 to 25 barns.</plot>

    <plot>Two chickens are laying eggs. You'll know one's about to drop when a chicken stands up. As they drop down the chutes, Farmer Big Bird moves back and forth to catch them. Different chute patterns make the game more difficult. This kids game is based on the classic Sesame Street character. It is intended for use with the kids controller, which is an oversized keyboard controller into which you insert the included overlay for this game. If you don't have a kids controller, the keyboard controller works fine, but you'll have to figure out what the buttons do</plot>

    <plot>As in the arcade game of the same name, Blueprint gives you, as J.J., three chances to save the damsel in distress from a menacing creature chasing her across the top of the screen. Navigate J.J. through a maze of houses, which contain either a piece of the Rube-Goldberg-esque monster-fighting contraption whose blueprint lies at the bottom of the screen, or a bomb which must be disposed of in short order. Pressing the button will make J.J. run faster, but like so many who spend a lot of time sitting at the Atari 2600, he has a limited amount of "Fast run time" (as indicated by a handy bar graph). Smaller but still pesky monsters also pop out of the bomb disposal pit and try to prematurely start the machine (which shakes it to bits). Once that occurs, those monsters must be lured back to their pit, and the machine must be reassembled. Build the machine in time, and you can blast the creature who's chasing your girlfriend. The Atari 2600 edition simplifies the graphics drastically (though the most elaborate part of the playing field -- the blueprint itself -- is more or less intact), and drops the sound effects back to bare minimum (so much for the game's catchy little jazzy background tunes). There are no control issues, however, and the end result is still quite colorful and a lot of fun.</plot>

    <plot>Boggle is an unreleased game for the Atari 2600 programmed by David Crane while he was still working at Atari. In Boggle, which is based on the popular word game of the same name, you must form as many words as possible from a random 4x4 grid of letters. The 2600 version of the game is for two players only, and each player can form a maximum of eight words (likely due to memory constraints of the 2600). The game appears to be fairly close to completion, although there are some glitches, such as all the letters not appearing in the grid right away when you start the game. Still, it's an interesting prototype and it's unknown why Boggle was not completed and released.</plot>

    <plot>Your objective is to roll as high a score as possible, whether you're playing a one-player or a two-player game.  There are ten "pins" to knock down.  You have two tries (or rolls) to knock down the pins each time you're up.  Each game consists of ten "frames" (or turns).[CR]If you succeed in knocking down all the pins on your first roll, it's called a "strike".  A strike is marked with an "x" on the TV screen.[CR]If you leave pins standing, but "pick them up" on your second try, it's called a "spare".  Spares are marked with a "/" on the screen.[CR]An "open frame" occurs when you fail to knock down all then pins in two rolls.  Open frames are indicated with a straight horizontal line (-) on the screen.[CR]The ultimate goal in BOWLING is to roll 12 consecutive strikes for a "perfect" score of 300.</plot>

    <plot>Boxing shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a "knockout") or two minutes have elapsed (a "decision"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.[CR]While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the "ropes" and "juggling" him back and forth between alternate punches.</plot>

There are six different puzzles included, which are:[CR]•Touch Me: The computer will play a sequence of tones. Each button on the controller represents a different tone, and by pressing the correct button you need to recreate the same sequence.[CR]•Count Me: The computer will display a sequence of numbers. Using the controller, you need to press the numbered buttons in the same order the computer displayed them.[CR]•Picture Me: The computer will display a series of symbols. It will then scramble the order they are displayed in, and you need to reorder the symbols back into their original configuration.[CR]•Find Me: The computer will display a series of objects on the screen, and you need to select the object which is dissimilar from the others. Your score is based on how fast you can successfully do this.[CR]•Add Me: The computer will display a list of numbers. You need to enter in the sum of the numbers before the timer runs out.[CR]•Play Me: This game allows you to play your own songs in free form mode; each button on the controller represents a musical note. Both controllers can be used for a duet, and several example songs are included in the instruction manual.</plot>

    <plot>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. [CR]To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.</plot>

    <plot>Ahh Cabbage Patch Kids.  Who could forget those chubby little dolls that started fist fights between middle aged housewives in toy stores?  For some reason every kid had to have one of these creepy little kewpie dolls back in the 80's, although the fad eventually faded.  Since Cabbage Patch Kids just happened to be manufactured by Coleco, it was only natural that they would create a video game tie in.  While the Colecovision version of Cabbage Patch Kids was released to much success, the Atari 2600 version never materialized.[CR]If you're scratching your head as to how someone could create a game based on a line of dolls, you're not alone.  Dolls don't exactly inspire video games.  However Coleco got around this by taking an existing game for the MSX line of computers called Athletic Land and adding the Cabbage Patch Kids into the game.  Since the MSX computer was never released in the US, people were none the wiser.  This is also why a game that was supposedly aimed at children seems so damn hard.[CR]Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park (which will be henceforth referred to as CPK) is a side scrolling action game.  According to the Colecovision version's manual, Anna Lee has decided to go out for some exercise in the local park and is soon caught up in a wild adventure (hence the subtitle Adventures in the Park).  The game is separated into several different screens (referred to in the game as scenes), each with a different obstacle for your kid to overcome.  Obstacles include bouncing balls, water filled pits, floating platforms, bees, and even fires.  Each level consists of ten scenes which must all be overcome before the time limit runs out.  Along the way Anna may also collect various objects hidden in the trees (using well placed trampolines) for points, but these objects are not necessary to win.[CR]CPK was known to exist for some time thanks to an interview conducted with another former Coleco programmer Ed English several years ago.  Ed was thought to be in possession of the only known prototype, but he would not release it for unknown reasons.  However in 2008 several Coleco EPROMs were found in a flea market, several of which contained various versions of CPK.  These EPROMs were released to the public shortly afterwards.[CR]While it may not be able to compare graphically to the Colecovision version, the Atari 2600 version of CPK is an amazing feat of programming.  Not only was all the gameplay retained in this conversion, but it even included a cute little background tune which was a rarity in 2600 games.  It appears that CPK was simply a victim of the collapsing game market, and by the time the final version was ready in September of 1984, Coleco had stopped its 2600 operations.</plot>

    <plot>CANYON BOMBER GAMES[CR]GAME 1: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)[CR]Test your skill against the computer.  It's not an easy task.  You've got six misses in which to match wits with the computer for a higher score.  Each time the bricks in the canyon are hit, the remaining bricks "fall" to a lower level (rather than remaining stationary in their original position).  Bricks that fall to a lower level are worth the points designated for that level.[CR]Keep an eye on the solid bar beneath your score on the upper right side of the screen.  It is a "miss indicator" and gradually decreases in length each time you miss until six misses are recorded and the game ends.  The bar is also color-coordinated with your planes and your score.[CR]Set your sights for 1000 points.  Although the game will not end if you reach the 1000 point mark, it's an excellent goal to set for yourself since it will be very difficult to obtain.[CR]GAME 2: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)[CR]This game differs from Game 1 only in that you are competing against another player rather than the computer.  Play ends when six misses are recorded against both players.  the player with the highest score wins. [CR]Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent's "miss indicator" as well as your own.  Bombs away![CR]GAME 3: Canyon Bomber (One-Player)[CR]This one's the same as Game 1 with one exception.  Rather than falling to a lower level, the bricks in the canyon stay "suspended" in their original position when the surrounding bricks are hit.[CR]GAME 4: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)[CR]You compete with another player the same as in Game 2.  This time however, the brick remain suspended instead of falling to a lower level.[CR]GAME 5: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)[CR]Get set for a test of your endurance and concentration.  The first player to score 1000 points wins.  No time limit and no limit to the number of bombs or misses.  Falling, rather than suspended bricks are programed into this game.[CR]No "miss indicator" will appear on the screen in games with unlimited bombs.[CR]GAME 6: Canyon Bomber (Two-Player)[CR]This game program is identical to Game 5, except that the bricks stay suspended.[CR]SEA BOMBER GAMES[CR]GAME 7: Sea Bomber (One-Player)[CR]You're playing against the computer.  Set the level, release the bomb, and boom, you're ready for action.  Sounds easy, but the computer's a real steady competitor.  If you score 1000 points before the computer does, you're a winner![CR]GAME 8: Sea Bomber (Two-Player)[CR]This time you're competing against another player in a race to the 1000 point mark.</plot>

Once all the icons were collected the player would have to arrange them in a certain order before time ran out.

    <plot>It's an age-old battle of cats versus dogs. Take control of one brave cat and race through the maze, but beware--you're not alone! Dogs are lurking to find your cat and turn him into lunch! Race to the potion and transform into the Dog Catcher to impound those puppies...but watch out, they'll be back! It's a mad scramble in which you're out-numbered three to one. Can you out-run--and out-last--your canine opposition? Make CAT TRAX and find out![CR]Cat Trax is a game originally written for the Emerson Arcadia 2001 by UA Ltd., and apparently slated to be released on the Atari 2600. While it was never commercially released by UA Ltd., it did appear on a European multi-cart under the name Cat N Mouse. It's unknown why this game (and the other UA prototypes) were never released commercially.[CR]Cat Trax is available in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store and includes a professionally printed box, manual and label, with artwork created by Dave Exton.</plot>

A visit will cost $20, at which time you'll find yourself in her bed. Score with her as many times as you can before you're forced to leave for the next. The cops are in pursuit as well as a mugger who wants your money. Visiting a wrong house will cause you to be temporarily immobilized (a sitting duck for the cops) as you figure out what to do next. The roles of the men and women are switched in Gigolo.</plot>

    <plot>The player moves the character about the bottom area of the screen and fires laser shots at a centipede advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of mushrooms. Shooting any section of the centipede creates a mushroom; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the board, with the first section of the rear piece becoming a new head. If the head is destroyed, the section behind it becomes the next head.</plot>

    <plot>In the 80's, the popular commercial for Purina dog food included a dog chasing a tiny chuckwagon across the kitchen floor. Inspired by this, Chase the Chuckwagon was produced by Spectravision and released as a promotional item from the Ralston Purina Company. Buy lots of dog food and you could own this. The simple rarity of this game combined with its historical coolness makes it one of the "holy grail" games. The object is to navigate the dog through a maze in an effort to reach the chuckwagon, while avoiding the dog catcher and other obstacles. If he makes it, an animation shows the dog chasing after the chuckwagon and stopping to eat the dog food that falls out of it.</plot>

You must pop balloons by catching a clown on the teeter-totter and bouncing him up to the balloons. Use the controller to move the teeter-totter across the screen to catch the clowns. Each time a clown pops a balloon, the balloon will disappear and you score points. Each player receives five clowns or turns. If you fail to catch a clown on the teeter-totter he will crash and disappear from the playfield. Press the controller button and another clown will bounce off the trampoline from the right or left corner of the playfield. After five clowns have crashed the game is over. The clowns may land on any point on the teeter-totter except where the other clown is sitting, which causes them to crash.</plot>

    <plot>Combat 2 is video game for the Atari 2600. Originally announced in 1982, it was subsequently cancelled. Developed by Atari, the game was supposed to be the sequel to the classic Atari VCS game Combat, which was bundled with the system. In 2005 it finally saw release on the Atari Flashback 2 dedicated console, and has seen two subsequent releases, the first in the 2011 Nintendo DS compilation Atari's Greatest Hits Volume II and the second in the iPhone and Android app Atari Greatest Hits, initially released in 2012.[CR]Environments were an arena with a river in the middle with two bridges, forests that the tanks can use for cover, and brick walls that could be shot through or used for cover. The tanks themselves moved by themselves with the player turning the tank and controlling the speed. This game had three lives that could be used — three hits and the player loses a life — while the original allowed you to get as many shots in until the time ran out. The graphics overall were improved over the original.[CR]The game was cancelled, probably due to the video game crash of 1983, and was forgotten until 200 copies of the prototype were produced in cartridge form and sold at the Classic Gaming Expo in 2001. The prototype featured the unfinished game, which included the features listed above, but people were surprised to find a level editor inside the game.[CR]The game was featured in Retro Gamer Issue 15 in the "Games That Weren't" section.</plot>

    <plot>Confrontation is a strange strategy game which was never commercially released, but was available directly from Answer for a short time.  Only people who saw it on display at the 1983 CES show would have know about it and ordered it so while it's not technically a prototype, it's close enough.  I've racked my brain on how to best describe the gameplay of this game, and after much searching I've determined the best description is in Leonard Herman's "ABC's to the VCS" (pick up a copy today!).  Since Confrontation uses a programming trick to display so many objects on the screen at once, screenshots will only show one players pieces at a time.  Take my word for it, they're really all there.[CR]Confrontation is a very unique game which can only be played by two opposing players.  In this unusual chess-like game, each player controls four pawns and a captain.  The blue player's pawns are lined up vertically along the left border of the playfield while the red player's pawns are along the right. Blue's Captain is at the top center of the playfield and red's is at the bottom.  The object of the game is to move your four pawns to the opposite side of the board where they will be removed.  Once all of your pawns are gone, you must get your captain over to your opponent's side of the board and remove it also.  The first player to remove all of his pieces wins the game. [CR]Moving the pieces is also an unusual process.  Each player controls a bar which runs horizontally across the width of the playfield.  You must place the bar over the piece that you wish to move.  You must then press the red firing button once if you wish to move a pawn and twice if you want to move your captain.  Once your piece is 'locked in' you can move it either horizontally or vertically.  However your piece cannot move over a spot which is already occupied by another piece.  Your Captain has the ability to move into a space occupied by one of your opponent's pawns.  If this occurs, you will send his pawn back to its starting position. [CR]While you move your pieces, you'll constantly use up your energy which is monitored at the top and bottom of the screen.  When you are completely out of energy you'll be immobilized for three seconds, allowing your opponent to move pieces without any trouble.  At the end of the three seconds, your energy will be completely recharged.  Throughout the game a pod will move around the playfield with the letter 'E' flashing on and off.  If you touch it while the letter appears you'll be receive a full supply of energy no matter how much you might have remaining.[CR]Confrontation is a highly original strategy game in an era when fast paced action and shooting games were all rage.  If more innovative games like this had been released the crash of 83-84 may not have happened.  But as we all know the video game industry was done in by bad clone after bad clone, and Answer Software was not immune to its effects.  Games like Confrontation were left in dust, never even reaching store shelves.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/confrontation/confrontation.htm</plot>

    <plot>Congo Bongo is an isometric platform arcade game released by Sega in 1983. The game has come to be seen as Sega's answer to the highly successful Donkey Kong game that was released two years prior. The player takes the role of a red-nosed safari hunter who tries to catch an ape named "Bongo". The hunter seeks Bongo to exact revenge for an apparent practical joke in which Bongo set fire to the hunter's tent, giving him a literal "hotfoot".</plot>

    <plot>In the first stage, the player must fend off meteor showers from all four sides of the screen by pushing the joystick to fire in the desired direction. The second stage requires the player to pilot a shuttle to a planet and use its tractor beam to pick up life forms. While near the planet's surface, planetary defenses will fire at the shuttle. If hit, one previously captured specimen will be freed, forcing the player to retrieve another. After a set period of time, a klaxon will warn of renewed meteor activity, and the player must return immediately to defend the ark.</plot>

    <plot>In Cosmic Swarm, you must use your Asteroids-like spacecraft to pick off space termites one by one. These pesky termites will place deadly blocks around the screen, making it difficult for you to fly around freely. If you manage to hit a termite as it carries its block, all of the blocks will turn red, and you can destroy them one by one until you hit another termite. Also, you'll need to contact the fuel ship whenever it appears in order to keep your ship operational.</plot>

    <plot>This game was developed concurrently for the Atari 2600 and 7800, but only the 7800 version was released. The 2600 version only has three levels as opposed to six on the 7800, but those three levels are well utilized considering the limitations of the 2600.[CR]As an Ornithologist, you must protect the eggs of the South American Hornbill that are nested in your tree. Various predators attempt to steal the eggs from under your nose. Using your slingshot, you must defend the eggs until the timer runs out. If a predator steals an egg you still have a chance to save it, but you risk losing other eggs from the tree while you are distracted.[CR]Next you must protect the Hornbills that have chosen to nest in the sewers, where the gameplay is the same as the tree level. Finally you move onto a bonus round at the Rooster Ranch, here you must shoot roosters that pop out of windows.[CR]This version of Crack'ed was released at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, complete with a unique label, box and instructions.</plot>

A succession of alien spacecraft and creatures take center stage in the middle of the screen, and players must line the two cannons up to most efficiently deal with all of the enemies while also using the smallest amount of fuel possible (end-to-end sweeps of the screen, while deadly and impressive, simply aren't practical). Some of the enemies, not content to just be evasive, return fire, providing another way for the player's cannons to be destroyed.</plot>

    <plot>You know those cheap little tile puzzles, where you shift tiles one space at a time to try to reform a picture that has been mixed up? That's what this game is like. Move the tiles on the big square (5x5) one at a time, and try to form the pattern shown on one of the little squares (3x3) within the middle 9 tiles of the big square. The game is set up with two big squares for grueling two-player competition.[CR]Cubicolor was designed by Rob Fulop of Imagic fame. Supposedly, only 50 were produced, and each cartridge is numbered. The rarity and legend of this game make it potentially the most sought-after 2600 game in existence.</plot>

    <plot>Dark Chambers is an arcade action game similar to Gauntlet. You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can. Hidden somewhere in each of the levels is an exit which will take you on to the next level. Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.</plot>

Meanwhile you must avoid a constant barrage of fireballs and heat-seeking missiles that are fired at you from time to time, as well as the shields themselves, which will close in on you if you're too slow in hitting the generators.</plot>

    <plot>Defender is a two-dimensional, side-scrolling shooting game set on the surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are successfully abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three chances (lives) to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks.</plot>

You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.</plot>

    <plot>Desert Falcon is an arcade style shooter. Many of the Pharaoh's great treasures are lost throughout the desert, and your goal is to steal as many as you can to earn points. The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</plot>

    <plot>The objective of Dig Dug is to eliminate underground-dwelling monsters. This can be done by inflating them until they pop or by dropping rocks on them. There are two kinds of enemies in the game: Pookas, round red monsters (said to be modeled after tomatoes) who wear yellow goggles, and Fygars, green dragons who can breathe fire. The player's character is Dig Dug, dressed in white and blue, and able to dig tunnels. Dig Dug is killed if he is caught by either Pooka or Fygar, burned by a Fygar's fire, or crushed by a rock.</plot>

    <plot>Dishaster is an action game released for the Atari 2600 in 1983 by Zimag. Another version of the game was released by Bit Corporation under the name Dancing Plates which features oriental-themed graphics and adds eight game variations.[CR]Dishaster was inspired by the circus tradition of keeping spinning plates suspended on poles. The player controls a girl attempting to keep a group of several spinning plates balanced on poles from falling. The game received negative reviews; criticism focused on the game's repetition and monotony.[CR]The girl can stabilize wobbling dishes by pressing the button on the controller. If a plate falls, the player is able to capture it if the girl touches it before it hits the ground, and a new one appears at the top of the pole. The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest. The player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground</plot>

    <plot>Listen!  An endangered dolphin is calling you!  Only by learning the dolphin's sonic language can you guide her through schools of seahorses, battling a monstrous squid, to gain magic powers from and elusive seagull.  Hurry!  Lend an ear...[CR]You will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by listening to sonic tones and catching waves. Pay attention to the following:[CR]THE SEAGULL:  [CR]Periodically, a seagull will fly overhead.  You'll know he's coming when the squid changes color.  Have your dolphin leap up, touch the seagull and then quickly turn and chase the squid.  This is the best way to gain points.  Also, the game resets at the next difficulty level putting distance between your dolphin and the squid.[CR]THE SLIP:  [CR]Another great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him "the slip".  If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave.  Then, reverse your dolphin's direction and swim under him immediately.  As long as the squid's good wave remains on the screen, he won't be able to reverse and catch you.[CR]SCORING:  [CR]Points are earned in a variety of ways.  Every time your dolphin touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points.  The number of points depends on the color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid.[CR]Also, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each time you run the squid into a bad wave.  And, when your dolphin swims through the seahorses, you'll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your degree of accuracy in getting her through the opening.</plot>

    <plot>Double Dunk is a simulation of two-on-two, half-court basketball. Teams have two on-screen characters, a shorter "outside" man and a taller "inside" man. In a single-player game, the player controls the on-screen character closest to the ball, either the one holding the ball (on offense) or the one guarding the opponent with the ball (on defense). In two-player games, each player may control one of the two teams as in a one-player game, or both players may play on the same team against a computer-controlled opponent.</plot>

So, please read these directions and give yourself some practice time. Then you can aim for the World Record.[CR]Game 1: Straight-ahead Dragster, one or two players.[CR]Game 2: Steerable Dragster, one or two players.[CR]Your Joystick Controller is both the clutch and gear shift for your Dragster; the red button is your gas pedal. Use left Joystick for the top car; right one for bottom car. Hold Joystick with button at the upper left.[CR]To shift gears, clutch by pushing Joystick to the left and shift by letting the Joystick spring back to the center.[CR]Your car starts each race in neutral (N). There are four gear positions--1, 2, 3, 4--and you must clutch and shift between each gear. You cannot downshift.[CR]When the countdown reaches 0, you can start. If you drop into gear too soon, before the end of the countdown, EARLY will appear on the screen and you have to wait for the next race. You can clutch during the countdown, but you cannot drop into 1st until  the countdown reaches 0.[CR]The object of Dragster is to beat your opponent across the screen, or to race against the clock for best time.</plot>

    <plot>Dukes of Hazzard was a prototype that was never released, The game starts by default on level 0, but you can choose to start on any level from 0 to 10. The object of the game is pretty straightforward- you must traverse up through Hazzard county (a layout of nearly 11 screens) and reach the jail before Boss Hog catches up with Daisy, as shown at the top of the screen. Pushing UP applies the gas and LEFT/RIGHT controls the steering. Rosco (in his police car) chases you throughout the county in an effort to stop you (you’ll hear his police siren when he’s near); if caught, you’ll lose one of your 4 cars, and start over at the bottom of the course. Nails can be found along the way and used to temporarily disable Rosco’s cruiser. However, they can damage your car’s tires just as easily, so you must drive very slowly over them to safely pick them up. Pressing the FIRE button drops the nails. You have another advantage in that your car can move diagonally (Rosco’s can’t). A good tip for the higher levels is to keep his car in sight behind you while moving up. If he scrolls off the screen, he’ll possibly reappear right in front of you!</plot>

    <plot>Based off the 1984 movie, Dune was to be an action/adventure game along the same lines the classic 2600 game Adventure.  Dune was originally started by veteran programmers Bruce Poehlman and Gary Stark before they began working on the 5200 game "The Last Starfighter" (which also went unreleased).  Unfortunately Gary and Bruce had only gone through the brainstorming process when work was stopped.  However it appears that another programmer may have been assigned to pick up and continue work on Dune.  Unfortunately only preliminary coding had been started before Jack Tramiel shut down 2600 game development and fired most of the staff.</plot>

If you miss any eggs, they will break and yolk starts collecting at the bottom of the screen. Miss too many, and the game will be over. At the end of each round you will be given an opportunity to earn bonus points; you now get to throw all of the eggs you caught back at the bird! As the levels progress, the games speed will increase. There are two difficulty levels available, in the easier variation you get a larger hat to catch the eggs with.</plot>

    <plot>A sequel to Adventure?  Yes it appears that Warren was tinkering with a sequel to his smash hit Adventure in his spare time while working at The Learning Company which he founded in 1980 after leaving Atari.   It’s unknown if Atari actually ordered a sequel or if Warren was doing this on his own and hoping to sell it to Atari.  However since Atari was considering calling SwordQuest: Earthworld Adventure II (and Fireworld Adventure III) the later scenario sounds more plausible.  Either way, this prototype has an air of mystery about it.</plot>

    <plot>Eli's Ladder is an educational game aimed at children, where math problems need to be solved to help Eli and his crew climb a ladder to his space ship so they can then journey to the Moon. The game included a wall chart and stickers designed to help motivate children progress through the problems. This is one of the rarest Atari 2600 games and apparently saw fairly limited distribution.</plot>

    <plot>Silly name aside, Elk Attack is really a Pac-Man type game but without a maze.  You control a Yo-Yo type machine, which must use its string to latch onto and destroy all the colored blocks on the screen.  Along the way you'll encounter strange worm like creatures (sorry no elks), which will attempt to disrupt your Yo-Yo.  To help you fight the worms there are power squares scattered around the board which when grabbed will render your Yo-Yo temporarily invincible and increase your speed.   However unlike Pac-Man touching a worm while invincible will only net you points, and will not destroy of them.  Because of this its best to just go about your business and clear the maze instead of hunting down the worms.</plot>

Will you allow this peace-loving race to be wiped out, or can your antimatter ammunition blast the evil ones out of orbit? You'll need to do some pretty fast fighting with your paddle controller to pull this one out. We find it hard to call this a game...</plot>

    <plot>Enduro is an action racing game similar to Pole Position. Your goal is to last as long as you can in an enduro race; each day of the race you are required to pass a certain number of cars. If you succeed, you get to continue on, fail and you are out of the race. The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by; not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts of light, but the seasons can change as well. Snow, ice, and fog will occasionally appear to make driving more treacherous. With each day that passes, the other cars will become faster and more aggressive. At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.</plot>

    <plot>The Entity is an unreleased 20th Century Fox game based on a horror movie sharing the same name. It's odd that Fox decided to go forward with this project, given the movie's disturbing adult theme where a young woman is raped by a ghost. This could very well be why Fox didn't release the game, although the game itself has little in common with the movie's subject matter. The Entity was programmed by Mark Kline, who was responsible for two other unreleased Fox games, Pick Up and Look Ahead.</plot>

Your only salvation is that you have discovered the secret to the "make-break." Grab them, and you can break through walls when you get stuck, or create a wall behind you - if you are being chased. The longer you survive, the faster you have to move. Explore alone, or two archeologists can work together or compete in a frenzied trek through the catacombs.</plot>

    <plot>Extra Terrestrials was originally programmed in 1984 by Herman Quast and Silk Screen Games in Brantford Ontario, Canada. Unfortunately, by the time the game was finished, the video game market had crashed and since Silk Screen Games had no distributor, only sold a few hundred copies at most to local stores and door to door. Because this game wasn't officially licensed, it never popped up on any list until Silk Screen Games founder Peter Banting found a copy and donated it to the Personal Computer Museum.</plot>

    <plot>You are an air traffic controller at an international airport. You must guide planes in to landing safely.[CR]Your first screen is the Approach Control Radar screen or ARC. You must guide the aircraft , using the cursor, until they are headed left to right along the yellow line headed towards the black stripe. Make sure the other planes are headed where they won't immediately head towards each other or off screen.[CR]After the plane gets near the black stripe, move the cursor to the center red light and press the button. You will then be on the Ground Control Approach screen or GCA. Here you must center the plane's nose on the glide slope and localizer before it arrives at the end of the runway. If the landing is successful, the plane will disappear from the ARC screen and a new one will appear soon to take its place. If not, when you press your joystick button and return to the ARC screen, the plane will still be there. If a plane starts flashing on the ARC and you hear an emergency sound, this plane has an emergency and must be landed first.</plot>

    <plot>TEST PILOT LOG MARCH 17, 2093:  On what started to be the routine high speed test of interplanetary craft Delta 12, a power plant malfunction caused the craft to skip off the rim of a small, black hole.  After experiencing level 5 turbulence I became unconscious.  Upon awaking, I found myself in a time and place unknown to me;  the craft having been completely destroyed.[CR]The place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.  Through thought waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical.  As their biological body parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical parts.  Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire society composed of machines.[CR]During this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the expense of others in the society.  They became know as the Bad-Bugs.  After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began attacking the good creatures.[CR]Because of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot the good bugs have asked for my help.  I have been put in command of the best machine-bug on their planet.  My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.  I will, however, be awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  [CR]To further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie.  They have warned me to be very cautious when approaching the Pixy since it is constantly guarded by a killer, machine-bee.</plot>

    <studio>Suntek</studio>
    <plot>Talk about a game with convoluted history!  It was once thought that Spinning Fireball, along with Pizza Chef, Immies and Aggies, and A Mysterious Thief, were all original games developed by a PAL company called Suntek.  However after much research it has been determined that these are in fact original NTSC games released by two different companies called Zimag and Vidco, which may have been related somehow.  So why were these games developed for the NTSC market but never released?  Read on to find out.[CR]Spinning Fireball is a half hearted attempt at a 3D target shooting game.  This is probably something that shouldn't have ever been attempted on the 2600, but Vidco decided to try it anyway.  The result is a game that looks decent, but plays horribly.  The goal of the game is to have your wizard create and shoot a fireball at the catapult that movies across the top of the screen.[CR]The controls for Spinning Fireball are bit difficult to master, which is just as well as you probably won't want to play this game very long.  To create your fireball, simply push and hold the joystick forward.  Once the fireball starts to spin (hence the name Spinning Fireball), press the fire button to shoot it.  The direction the fireball flies is based on the direction it was spinning when the button was pressed (sort of like the hammer throw in Track and Field).  If you are facing right the fireball will rotate clockwise, otherwise if you left the fireball will rotate counterclockwise. If your shot actually manages to hit the catapult (and good luck with that), then you will be taken to the second level. [CR]While Spinning Fireball may be short on thrills, there are some dangers you will face during your fire slinging exploits.  If your fireball hits the sides of the screen it will bounce back at you.  Likewise if you shoot your fireball straight up, it will come back down (run!).  If you manage to get hit by your wayward fireball, you will lose a life.  Also, the catapult at the top of the screen will occasionally shoot a fireball at you, as you may have guessed, being hit by this fireball will also result in losing a life.  You also have a limited amount of time to finish each level, if the timer hits zero you will (say it with me now) lose a life.  The timer starts a five minutes for the first level, and decreases one minute for each successive level (down to two minutes starting on level four).[CR]While it won't win any awards for good graphics or gameplay, Spinning Fireball is an interesting attempt to breathe some innovation into the tired old shooter formula.  Unfortunately the result was a game that needs more variety and polish before it could be considered fun to play.  The frustrating control scheme makes hitting the catapult more a matter of luck than skill. There's a reason these games never made it to the US.</plot>

    <plot>GAME 1: [CR]After programming your play, use the Joystick to control your players.  The offensive player controls only the ball carrier and the flight of the pass or punt.  The defensive player controls his lineman or, by holding the red controller button down, the defensive[CR]back.[CR]The players will randomly follow the play as programmed when not controlled by your Joystick.[CR]GAME 2: [CR]In this game, when your players are not controlled by the Joystick, they will follow the play exactly as programmed.  Use more strategy and try to outguess your opponent's plays.[CR]GAME 3: [CR]Program in your offensive and defensive plays and watch the computer run them out.  Neither player can control the players movements, but the offense can pass or punt the ball by pushing the red controller button.</plot>

    <plot>Ah, you poor woodcutter. You just want to cut some wood to sell so your family can eat but an evil witch has put a spell on the animals so they are attacking you. Well, no matter, one way or another you'll get your tree![CR]You must make your way two screens to the right to get to your tree. Animals will come at you from either side of the screen. You must either jump over the animal or press your button and push the joystick in the desired direction to chop them with your axe. Snakes cannot be chopped, only jumped over. [CR]Also to contend with is a bird in the air that is dropping stones. If you are hit by a stone, you will be unable to move for two seconds, which could prove fatal. Once you reach the tree, you must chop it down while still avoiding the animals. It takes four chops per side to fell the tree. If you need to, you can climb the tree to avoid animals. Once the tree is chopped, the game restarts at a faster level. You have only one life so if an animal touches you, it is game over.</plot>

    <plot>In the cold dark night you make your way through the ghoulish castle of Dr. Frankenstein. There you must prevent him from completing his creation.[CR]Your only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive.[CR]You start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool.[CR]You have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points</plot>

    <plot>Freeway was one of the first titles released by Activision in their effort to publish independent games for the Atari 2600. One or two players control chickens who can be made to run across a ten lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to "get to the other side." Every time a chicken gets across a point is earned for that player. If hit by a car, a chicken is forced back either slightly, or pushed back to the bottom of the screen, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to. The winner of a two player game is the player who has scored the most points in the two minutes, sixteen seconds allotted.</plot>

    <plot>Frog Pond is a games that Atari never officially released to the public.  2 different versions exist with this - one with a "rainbow" title screen, and one with a detailed graphics screen (most likely the final version).  An even earlier (work-in-progress) version was shown at the Summer 1982 CES show.  Prototypes (and possibly copies) have been available for some time now.  Best Electronics had it for $12 at one time. [CR]The game has nice, clean graphics.  The game features nice, clean graphics, with 1 or 2 frogs on a lily pad.  Each frog even has its own realistic "ribbet" sound.  The object is to leap and catch as many insects as you can with your frog's tongue.  Pressing the fire button shoots your frog's tongue out.  The difficulty switches affect the length of your tongue (a little longer when set to B).  There are four game variations: 1 and 3 are one-player versions; 2 and 4 are two-player versions.  You are allowed so many misses-an insect will fly away if you fail to get it after a certain time limit.  Games 3 and 4 allow more misses, but less time to get the insects.  There are five types of insects.  Since the game has no manual, I created names for each type:</plot>

Starting out underwater, reach the top of the pond while avoiding dangerous alligators and fish (you can ride a turtle for safety!). Once on top of the pond, hop across logs, birds, and even a whale to the life preserver trailing behind a tugboat. In the third location you have to hop across a flock of birds to reach a cloud at the top of the screen. Each frog has a time limit to safely reach one of the homes on each of the three screens. You move on to the next level when a frog has safely reached each of the homes on all screens.</plot>

    <plot>Frogs and Flies is a 1982 video game by Mattel for the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 platforms. In this game, the player or players control a frog sitting on a lily pad. One frog is green and the other frog is red. The game can be played either by one or two players. The object of the game is to eat the most flies.[CR]Each game starts out in the morning with a light blue sky. If there is not a second player, the system will automatically take control of the red frog within a few seconds. Each frog jumps from one lily pad to the other. During each hop, a number of flies fly around the screen. The player pushes the fire button, which causes the frog's tongue to stick out. If the frog is in the right spot ahead or behind a fly, it catches and eats the fly. Each time a fly is captured it is worth two points. The game progresses throughout the day, with the sky turning a darker shade of blue, and eventually turning black as the day ends. About a minute after the sky turns black, the two frogs leave the screen – the green frog exits to the left, and the red frog to the right. A firefly then comes on to the screen carrying a "The End" message, which it leaves in the center of the screen. The frog who has captured the most flies at that point is the winner.[CR]There are two different levels to Frogs and Flies that players can select. On the first level, the jumping off and landing points are fixed, the user needs to time their jumps to catch any flies who may come into the frog's flight path. On the second level, the frogs are free to move about the ground to catch flies as the jumping and landing points are not fixed. A player can even cause a frog to jump into the water – in that case, the frog will swim back on to the nearest pad. Generally this is to be avoided since it takes several seconds for the frog to swim back to the pad.[CR]A version of this game was also released for Mattel's IntelliVision system, titled Frog Bog; though it was graphically superior to Frogs and Flies, its controls were less fluent.</plot>

    <plot>Front Line (フロントライン Furonto Rain?) is a military-themed run &amp; gun shooter game released by Taito for arcades in 1982. It was one of the first video games to feature a ground combat theme and grenades.[citation needed] Military-oriented video games of the early 1980s usually involved vehicular combat, such as tanks, but did not include infantry. The original arcade version of Front Line consists of a joystick, a single button, and a rotary dial that can be pushed in like a button, which fires the weapon. The single button is used to throw grenades, and to enter and exit the tank.[CR]1985's Ikari Warriors follows the conventions established by Front Line, including the vertically scrolling levels, entering/exiting tanks, and not dying when an occupied tank is destroyed.</plot>

    <plot>You're an Eskimo who wants to build an igloo to live in during the cold season. To do this, you must jump from ice-block to ice-block, while avoiding wildlife such as birds and crabs. Coming with contact with any of these will cause them to push you off the block and into the deadly water. Once you have built your igloo, you must enter it to proceed to the next level. Remember, you must build it before the temperature drops to 0°. You have four lives.</plot>

Shoot small enemies with your bubble cannon to turn them into fruit, then steal the monster's energy! But don't get too confident, the next wave is faster and nestled amid an ocean bed of obstacles! One wrong move and you're sunk! Are you fish enough to save the ocean?[CR]Funky Fish is a port of the 1981 arcade game by Sun Electronics. It was programmed by UA Ltd., the same company that programmed all the games for the Emerson Arcadia 2001. It's unknown why this game (and the other UA prototypes) was never released commercially.</plot>

    <plot>In the single-player mode, the player controls a G.I. Joe training camp on the bottom of the screen protected by a barrier and armed with two laser cannons. In this mode the goal is to keep the giant Cobra-operated robot snake from destroying the shield and thus the training camp by hitting it eight times. The Cobra robot shoots venom and laser beams.[CR]In two-player cooperative mode control of the G.I. Joe training game is split between two players as they work to destroy the Cobra robot. In the two-player competition mode one player controls the Cobra robot and another player controls the training camp.[CR]Cobra Strike was the first video game to use the G.I. Joe license. The U.K. version of the game was renamed Action Man: Action Force.[CR]Synopsis:[CR]"The Action Force training camp is under siege from a giant Cobra Combat Machine built by the evil Baron Ironblood. As the Cobra looms over the camp the Action Force recruits run to shelter from its vaporizing venom and piercing laser beams. Man your positions! Defend the camp! Use missile attack cannons and atomic-powered energy shields to fight the deadly Cobra.</plot>

    <plot>Galaxian expanded on the formula pioneered by Space Invaders. As in the earlier game, Galaxian featured a horde of attacking aliens that exchanged shots with the player. In contrast to Space Invaders, Galaxian added an element of drama by having the aliens periodically make kamikaze-like dives at the player's ship, the Galaxip.</plot>

But don't hit the innocent hostages. Also make sure you shoot Nitro Ed before he drops his bomb off the roof and kills everyone. You've got a limited number of bullets, so be accurate. During night shoot-outs, only the flash of your gun will allow you to see what's going on.</plot>

To make things worse, there are holes in the road and other ships you need to shoot so as to not ram them.[CR]As you go along, you can accelerate or decelerate to avoid being bombed but be careful because you might ram some ships near the ground. You can jump to avoid them or blast them for points. You will also see numbers along your way. Run into them to acquire their point value. Do not shoot them or their value will be deducted from you score.[CR]As this is Gas Hog, you will soon run low on fuel. You must get below ground via the occasional holes, to grab a refuel marker. Do not stay below ground, however, as you travel in the wrong direction while there. You start with four lives and lose one if you are hit by a bomb or ship or run out of fuel.</plot>

    <plot>Ghostbusters II by Activision (the makers of the original Atari VCS Ghostbusters game) never even hit a store shelf in the United States. With the video game market (circa 1989) having shifted toward more advanced systems like the NES and Sega Master System, Activision felt it would be wasting its time releasing a new VCS game. Yet it was released overseas by Salu. In scenes inspired by the movie of the same name, Ghostbusters II puts players in the shoes of the apparition-apprehending heroes as they descend into a slime-filled underground tunnel, trying to blast ghosts and collect samples of "mood slime." Ghosts will attack both the player's Ghostbuster and the rope he's hanging from, and the Ghostbuster's "courage" meter must be monitored as well (though that can be replenished by picking up "elixir" power-ups in the tunnel). In the game's second level, players guide a mobile Statue of Liberty through the streets of New York City (echoing the movie's goofy climax), fending off more ghosts with her fireball-shooting torch and trying to keep a steady supply of "mood slime" to keep the statue moving.</plot>

    <plot>This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600.The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.Difficulty switchesUse the left switch to set the number of players; B for one player, A for two.Game variationsThere are five games, each with five skill levels.The skill levels differ by the amount of time you have to make words.Skill levels for one player games-Skill level 1=unlimited time (no clock)Skill level 2=132 secondsSkill level 3=39 secondsSkill level 4=26 secondsSkill level 5=random timesFor two player games, the times are half of what they are in one player.The games are-Game 1 (Billboard)- After each round, all the letters are reshuffled, so you get a whole new set of seven letters. Any letters that were not used go back into the mix.Game 2 (Skill Builder)- Only the letters you used to make the word are replaced. Any unused letters stay on the top spaces.Game 3 (Times Up)- You are given seven letters only. You must use these seven to make as many words as you can.Game 4 (Encore)- The letters on the top row all shift to the right, with the last letter disappearing and a new letter plopping into the first spot. You must grab you letters and place them quickly. Any letters the you don't use will reappear randomly again.Game 5 (Over the Edge)- Same as game 4 but letters that disappear never return.</plot>

    <plot>Golf features a nine hole, par 36 course which can be played by one or two players. The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.</plot>

The farmer must hit the gopher to send him back underground or fill in the holes to prevent him from reaching the surface. If gopher has taken any of the three carrots, a pelican will occasionally fly overhead and drop a seed which, if the farmer catches it, he can plant it in the place of the missing carrot. The longer the game, the faster the gopher gets. The game ends when the gopher successfully removes all three carrots. There are two skill levels and is for one or two players, giving a total of four game variations.</plot>

    <plot>Grand Prix is a Formula One Grand Prix motor racing-themed video game, and one of the first side-scrolling racing video games. It was designed and programmed by David Crane for the Atari 2600 video game console, and published by Activision in 1982.[CR]Grand Prix was the first Atari 2600 game to feature shaded objects in color. When David Crane developed an Atari 2600 programming technique for painting large, multicolored sprites on the screen, he made a color pattern that reminded him of Grand Prix racing stripes. This inspired him to design a Grand Prix racing game to apply his new technique.</plot>

    <plot>The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.</plot>

On the bottom center is the long range scanner. This shows you, the aliens and the super alien, but not the meteorites.[CR]As the super alien approaches, there will be an alarm sound. If the super alien catches you, you will be unable to move or fire and will lose a life. The game ends if you lose all your lives or get 999,999 points.</plot>

    <plot>The classic horror/comedy movie inspired this fun game. You take on the character Billy, who initially tries to keep the innocent Mogwai from eating after midnight and becoming gremlins. As the Mogwai fall from the top toward the hamburger, you must catch them. Any that get by eat and turn into pupas. When eight pupas have formed, they hatch one by one, unleashing the gremlins. The gremlins then march down toward you. You must shoot them before they reach and kill poor Billy. You have two flash cubes that you can use to scare them away if they get too close. Bright Light! Try to get them before they walk through water, as they'll multiply.</plot>

    <plot>Ahh Grover... The scary Muppet.  Well maybe it's just me, because some Atari executive saw it fit to give this furry blue demon his own 2600 game.  Originally the star of Grover's Egg Catch (that's right, Grover's Egg Catch!), the starring role was quickly given to Big Bird after someone at Atari woke up and realized that Grover had nothing to do with eggs and giant yellow bird might be a better choice (then again maybe Grover does lay eggs?).  After being booted from the egg catch, Grover was given the music maker gig (displacing one very upset monkey).  For you see Grover's Music Maker was originally called Monkey Music and featured a dancing monkey instead of the jumping blue hairball you see today.  What does Grover have to do with music you ask?  About as much as a dancing monkey does...</plot>

A second line of defense is a force field between your laser cannon and the planets, but it can only handle one hit at each spot. The game ends when all three planets are wasted.

    <plot>The gameplay is similar to that of Galaga but presented in a forced 3D perspective, with the player's ship facing 'into' the screen and able to move around the perimeter of an implicit circle. The scrolling starfield of earlier space shooter games is arranged to fit the 3D perspective, with the stars coming into view at the centre of the screen and flying outward, giving the impression of the player's ship moving through space.</plot>

    <plot>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</plot>

    <plot>Your character starts at the lower left of a multi-tiered screen and must make his way to the beautiful(?) woman to the right, however you'll soon find out that someone is out to stop your stud monkey conquests at all costs. The first obstacle you'll encounter takes the form of a sniper hiding in a bush. Why would a sniper be hiding in a bush just to shoot you in the buttocks? Why not? As you approach the bush a bullet will fly out in your direction, killing you if it makes contact. To get past the sniper, simply run away a few times until he has to reload (the bullets will stop) and then run past the bush. Once you're past the bush, you can run into your lady's loving arms and explore a different kind of bush… Each time you make it to one of the women, you will start the humping mini-game. Your goal here is to meet her thrusts by pushing right every time she thrusts her pelvis. If you're successful in your timing you will score a point and a tone will sound. Each time you score a point, the tone will get higher and higher indicating that danger is approaching. If you continue to score past a certain point (around 8 or so points) your woman will appear to explode and you will fall into a pit and die (I guess you were a little too much for her). To avoid this, make sure you push the button to escape before this happens. If you manage to score 69 points you will earn an extra life.The next obstacle you must face comes in the form of a river. While conceptually this is the easiest obstacle to clear, the iffy collision detection makes it much more difficult than it should be. To clear the river, simply run towards to it and push the button when your back foot is on the edge of the bank (not your front foot). Assuming you timed it right, you will go flying over the river and meet yet another woman. You know what to do…After you've scored as many points as you dare, you will be taken to the next area of the screen. Here you must run past a dangerous fire breathing dragon, which is much more difficult than it sounds. The trick to getting past the dragon is to wait for it to breathe fire, then quickly run by him. Once you're past the dragon you'll undoubtedly notice the large pit ahead of you. Here you must wait for the snake to change into a woman and then quickly drop down into the pit to do the deed. The timing on this is rather tricky as you can't simply wait around for the snake to change because the dragon is chasing you. If you manage to time it just right and find the woman, you'll be taken to the last area of the game.In this final area you must chase down the woman running around the top of the castle as they aren't just going to wait around for you anymore. As you chase your dream date, you'll notice that ugly little faces appear to be puking on you. These are actually gargoyles, and they're trying to dump lava on you. The gargoyles are easily avoided by stopping when they breathe fire, and since there are no other dangers on this level, you're free to stop and start the pursuit at will. Each time you catch the woman you can score a few points in the standard manner, but she'll run away again and the chase continues…</plot>

    <plot>Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.</plot>

    <plot>It's video Whack-A-Mole![CR]Each round consists of twenty-five moles. When a mole pops out of his hole, press the corresponding button on the Kid's Controller to whack it. The faster you hit him, the more points you'll get. If the King Mole pops up, whack him for even higher points. Beware of the acorn. If it pops up, don't whack it as it will cost you points. You must score at least three hundred points by the time the mole count reaches zero. If you reach or exceed three hundred points in one round, any points beyond three hundred will be added to your score as a bonus. If you fail to score three hundred points in one round, the game is over.</plot>

    <plot>MUST HAVE 2 PLAYERS TO PLAY! ~Rx[CR]Play HOME RUN just as you would play baseball. The left or blue player is the "visiting team" and is the first to bat. The pitcher-outfielder pitches the ball. Three _strikes_ (either swinging or pitched) are an out; four balls (any pitch not struck at that is NOT over the plate) are a walk and the batter advances to first base.[CR]If the pitcher hits the batter (and the batter does not strike at the pitch, or the pitch does not pass over Home Plate) the batter will advance to first base.[CR]If the batter hits the ball, the outfielder(s) can catch the ball and make a putout by touching first base ahead of the runner or by tagging the runner. If there are other runners on base, a putout can be made by tagging any runner or, if the runner is in a "force play", by touching the base in front of that runner. With practice, doubleplays (two outs on one pitched ball) can be made with ease.[CR]~From the Manual</plot>

    <plot>Ice Hockey is an ice hockey game for one player against the computer or two players. Each team consists of two players, one offensive and one defensive. At any given time one player is active and can be controlled while the other remains inactive; if the puck is near your goal then the defensive player becomes active, otherwise you control the offensive player. Each player has the ability to shoot the puck at a variety of angles, and can even body check their opponent! The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player more of an advantage.</plot>

Your buddy and you are on a special mission behind enemy lines, and you've been sleeping, eating, and breathing jungle combat for the last two weeks. Your tired, but that never affect your razor-sharp judgement and your will to survive.[CR]Your main weapons are machine guns, grenades, and your own cunning in the face of danger. Sometimes you'll have a tank at your disposal, which comes in handy when enemy fire is particularly brutal.[CR]You move swiftly through the jungle, wading through rivers and resting from time to time with the ruins of bombed-out buildings. You're turning out of ammunition and grenades but you know the battle can't last forever. Sooner or later, one side is going to emerge victorious. Let's just hope it's yours!</plot>

    <plot>Ixion is a port of the unreleased 1983 Sega coin-op of the same name, Ixion is an interesting game that doesn't seem to play like anything else in the 2600 library. Your goal in Ixion is to grab the five white squares scattered across the screen and spell the word Ixion before your time runs out. At the start of each level only certain squares are visible, and to get around more easily you must first reveal the missing squares. To reveal the missing squares, the player must move a brown sphere over an empty square. This sphere is normally stationary, but it can be moved by shooting or ramming into it. This sends the sphere bouncing around the screen, revealing squares and destroying enemies in its travels. After a short time of bouncing around the sphere will stop, requiring the player to move it again to reveal more squares. Learning how to move the sphere where you want is the key to mastering Ixion. Also moving around the game grid are enemy drones, which will attempt to destroy your ship. Unfortunately, their shots destroy tiles, making your path much more difficult to traverse. Enemy drones only take one shot to defeat, but will take out the tile they are on when they explode.</plot>

    <plot>Kabobber is just one of those games that defies definition.  Looking a bit like a cross between Q*Bert and Frogger, Kabobber is a game as strange as its name.  Along with Thwocker, Kabobber is one of the lost Activision titles that people all knew existed somewhere, but it wasn't until 2001 that a prototype was finally confirmed to exist and the rom was released.     Kabobber was never advertised or mentioned in any Activision catalogs.[CR]Since no instruction manual was ever made for Kabobber, we can only guess at what the storyline might have been.  Atari Age hosted a contest to come up with a story and manual that best fit the style of the game.  While we'll never know how close the winning entry was to the real storyline, it probably isn't too far off.  The story (such as it is) tells the tale of greedy Princess Buvsky who is attempting to devour the rainbow energy source of Kabobberland.  You must take your army of Buvskies and attempt to catch Princess Buvsky before she can reach the rainbow on the other side of the screen.  Along the way you must contend with the dangerous Kabobbers who are attempting to destroy your rescue party.[CR]The basic gameplay of Kabobber is very simple; you must hop on the enemy before he hops on you.  To help you gang up on the enemy you are given command of an army of Buvskies.  Your Buvskies troops appear in each of the squares immediately surrounding your character.  When first summoned your Buvskies are only babies who must first conquer an enemy Kabobber to be promoted to full strength.  Baby Buvskies can only conquer the green Guvskies and are crushed by all other enemies, so you must protect them until they reach full strength.  You are given a limited number of baby Buvskies (displayed at the bottom of the screen), although you can gain extra Buvskies by conquering enemy troops (you are limited to nine reserve Buvskies).  Your army moves with you in a square formation, so the more troops you have on the screen the bigger the target you are.  However the more troops you have the more enemies you can crush, and you'll have a less chance of being totally annihilated by a rampaging enemy mob.[CR]As the boards progress the enemies become faster and more numerous, and Princess Buvsky moves towards the rainbow faster.  The game ends once all your troops are lost or Princess Buvsky reaches the energy rainbow.  On the later levels it's all about strategy, simply jumping non-stop towards the Princess won't cut it anymore.  You must carefully decide which enemies are worth conquering, and which are best left alone.  Don't take too long however, as the Princess has her eye on the prize.[CR]Kabobber is an excellent action/strategy game by Rex Bradford, the man responsible for Jedi Arena and Empire Strikes Back.   So why did Kabobber never get released?  According to Rex:[CR]"What happened was that I "finished" the game in the standard 4K cartridge size, then Activision said they liked the game and would like me to expand it to an 8K cartridge and keep working on it.  I had basically run out of ideas for the game at that point, and resisted.  Anyway, I didn't feel like working on it more, and Activision didn't want to publish it as is (and was probably a little miffed at my attitude, though they never said so), and that was that."[CR]It's a shame Activision didn't want to release Kabobber as is, because it's a lot of fun and didn't really need anymore retooling.  Kabobber is proof that sometimes it's best to release games as is instead of reworking them to death.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/kabobber/kabobber.htm</plot>

    <genre>Sports</genre>
    <plot>Kamikaze Saucers was a little known 2600 game that most people assumed was never even started.  However after the programmer gave the rom image to Atari Age to be distributed to the gaming community, the game proved to be very much real.  There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it.  All these things make this prototype all the more interesting, and makes one wonder what other games Syncro may have had in the works.[CR]Kamikaze Saucers is your average shooter along the lines of Atlantis or Demon Attack.  You must shoot down the saucers that buzz across the screen using your oversized phallic looking ship.  If if fail to shoot the saucers down in a timely manner they will go Kamikaze on you big time!  Three large ships will come at you from the top of the screen, and if you can't destroy them before they crash into you you'll lose a life.[CR]Thankfully there's a little more to Kamikaze Saucers than mindless shooting.  Notice the two meters on each side of the screen?  These are your ammo meters, the left meter is for shooting from the left and the right meter for shooting on the right.  For some reason, shooting from the center counts as shooting from the left (as far as ammo is concerned).  The shooting in KS is a bit like Atlantis, all your shots are aimed towards the center of the screen.  So shooting from the left or right will cause your shots to angle towards the center like shooting from Atlantis's side guns.  This takes a bit to get used to, but actually makes the game more challenging.[CR]While Kamikaze Saucers isn't a bad game, it's nothing special.  In the "Me Too" clone environment that caused the great crash, Kamikaze Saucers would hardly get noticed.  Syncro made the right decision in staying out of the crumbling market, especially with lackluster games like this.  Kamikaze Saucers is just one of many victims of bad timing.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/kamikaze/kamikaze.htm</plot>

The monkeys will be trying to stop you by throwing or dropping apples and knocking you off the platforms. Your kangaroo has boxing gloves, however, and can knock out the monkeys with a single punch! Along the way various types of fruit can be collected to earn bonus points.</plot>

As your opponent steps toward you, do you stand your ground or step back or move into him? You block some of his kicks and punches, but how much can you take? Time ticks away, so you move in to unleash your arsenal of kicks and punches, trying for that elusive knockdown! When you win, you advance one belt: from white to red... all the way up to black belt expert. But when you lose, your opponent gets even tougher in the next match. You have to be good... or you may take the beating of your life!</plot>

    <plot>The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</plot>

    <plot>For decades, the weapons satellites have orbited Earth harmlessly. Now, for unknown reasons, they have dropped from the sky to obliterate mankind. You are a test pilot with an experimental craft that can stop the satellites. It is up to you to protect your home town.[CR]You fly above your town's forcefield. Satellites will drop from the sky and show on the radar area at the screen top. You must fly to them and shoot them before they reach the town as they have the ability to penetrate the town's shields. Be aware of your fuel because if you run out of fuel, you lose a life. Also, be aware of the laser heat indicator just below the fuel gauge. If the laser gets too hot, it will not fire until it cools. The town's forcefield may not be able to stop the satellites, however, it will stop your craft so flying into it is detrimental to your health. In later levels, you must contend with meteors as well as satellites. You cannot shoot the meteors but they cannot penetrate the town's shields. You will be destroyed and lose a life, however, if you ram into one.</plot>

    <studio>Apollo</studio>
    <plot>Over the years Apollo has released some strange games.  From the airline luggage simulator Lost Luggage to the egg throwing antics of Wabbit, Apollo was never afraid to release something different.  Therefore it's no surprise that when a new unknown Apollo prototype surfaced, it featured some interesting gameplay.  However Kyphus may be the strangest game from Apollo yet...[CR]Looking a little like a cross between Racquetball and Space Cavern, Kyphus is an odd game in which the player must maneuver a dumpy looking guy through a pseudo-3D maze of rooms avoiding what appears to be a glowing cloud that shoots lasers, while being followed by a multi-colored robot that just might be a monkey in disguise.  Like I said, this game is weird!.[CR]Unfortunately, this prototype is very incomplete.  There appears to be no collision detection, few sounds, and almost no gameplay.  The only thing one can really do in this prototype is to move run from room to room, although with no collision detection implemented there is no threat from the robot or cloud.  Each room of the maze appears to have a different color, and has three to four exits (two on the sides and one at the top and bottom).  The maze is made up of 64 rooms, but doesn't appear to have a set pattern.[CR]As you move through maze, you may notice the score and life counters start displaying odd letters and numbers.  These number and letters are actually variable values in hex decimal notation.  The programmer used these numbers to help determine the values of various game variables while developing the game.  The counters at the top of the screen display the players position coordinates, the left two digits in the score are a timer of some sort that is continually counting down, while the right two digits appear to be the room number.  It is unusual to see these in game unless it is very early in the development cycle.[CR]Although the prototype isn't very playable, by taking a look in the game itself we can puzzle out some planned gameplay.  Hidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy, and Invoke.  It is thought that these are commands the player would give the robot to make it do certain things.  Also hidden in the game code are graphics for what appears to be a large monkey that would have replaced the robot.  It is currently unknown how the monkey would be used in the game, and there is no way to trigger it (without hacking the code) in the current prototype.[CR]Although Kyphus is unplayble in its current state, it shows quite a bit of promise.  Getting the 2600 to display anything that looks remotely like 3D is an amazing feat.  It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear.  Hopefully a more complete version of the game will turn up someday, but for now we can be happy in that another lost prototype has finally been found.</plot>

    <plot>The object of Laser Blast is to destroy a series of land-based enemies. The player controls a fleet of flying saucers, operating one at a time. On the planet surface below are a group of three mobile laser bases, guarded by an invisible force field that prevents the player's saucer from getting too close to the surface. Both the player and the enemy bases are armed with laser blasters, which may fire a single continuous beam at a time. The player must destroy all three bases before they are able to target the saucer and fire their own laser blasts in defense. If the player's saucer is hit, it will lose altitude and crash to the ground; however, the player may direct this fall, potentially into one of the bases, destroying it as well. Each succeeding wave of enemy bases moves faster and targets the player's saucers more quickly, while the force field becomes stronger and decreases the amount of space in which the saucer can move.[CR]Players score points for each base destroyed, with points multiplying each wave up to a maximum of 90 points per base. Players earn extra flying saucers with each 1000 points scored and may keep a maximum of six extra saucers in reserve.[CR]Players who scored 100,000 points or more could submit photographic proof to Activision and be admitted to the Activision Federation of Laser Blasters.</plot>

    <plot>During World War II, German bombs turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Hoping to undermine the strong spirit of the British, every night the Germans dropped bombs on the citizens of London. Mast bombs exploded on impact, but some would sit minutes, hours, or days before detonating. It was up to the British Army Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXBs). There were many types of UXBs and the engineers had to learn each. The bombs did have some things in common: they required sharp thinking, delicate treatment, and split-second timing. in LONDON BLITZ you are assigned to the Royal Engineers and are tasked to keep your sector of London free of bombs. There are several types of bombs, each requiring special skills which you had better learn. Excellent performance will be rewarded by promotions, but damaged property may get you 'busted.' There are three ways for you to get out of this nasty business:[CR]Be removed from the service for incompetence [busted below Lance Corporal].[CR]Receive a posthumously awarded Victoria Cross, or[CR]Be promoted to the rank of Captain where you can turn your attention to administrative details.</plot>

    <plot>Based on the obscure 1981 Venture Line coin-op of the same name, Looping is one of the few prototypes that was known to be 'out there', but could not be located.  Thankfully Looping finally surfaced in 2003 and was released to the gaming community.  Amazingly the 2600 version of Looping plays very close to the Colecovision original with the requisite downgrade in graphics and sound of course.  However since Looping wasn't exactly a graphical masterpiece to begin with, the downgrade isn't really all that noticeable.[CR]As the game title suggests, this game involves looping.  By looping I mean that your plane can only move in circles instead up the normal up, down ,left, right movement of most games.  By pushing up or down, your plane will begin to arch and start its loop (pushing left and right has no effect).  Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem, but your plane also moves very VERY fast, so it's quite easy to crash into the ground or another obstacle before your can complete your loop.  One interesting thing to note is that if your plane hits the top of the screen it will nosedive straight down.  While at first this may seem like a major inconvenience, it can be used to your advantage if you're crafty enough. [CR]Looping is separated into two main sections: The Airfield and The Pipe Maze.  Each level begins on the runway of the airfield where you must start the game by successfully taking off (just pull down on the stick).  Assuming you didn't crash into the building at the end of the runway, you're now airborne and can begin to complete your mission.  There are three possible missions depending on what level you are playing: Destroy the Terminal, Destroy the Missile, or Destroy the Terminal and Missile.  To destroy your target, you're going to have to shoot through the blocks that make up the structure, which as you may have guessed is easier said than done.  Since your plane is constantly moving at high speed you can only take a few shots at your target before passing it over (or flying into it if you're not too talented).  Also making your life miserable are several balloons which bounce around the screen at alarming speed.  Although you can shoot these balloons you end up crashing into them more often than not.  [CR]If you succeed in destroying your target it will turn gray and the gate at the far end of the Airfield will open revealing the next section of the game.[CR]The Pipe Maze (as the name suggests) is a huge maze of pipes which you must fly though in order to reach "The End".  The first room in this maze is fairly open, with several paths to take to the next room.  The main enemy in this room is a large green drop of ooze which constantly drips from one of the pipe opening.  This drop is fairly easy to avoid unless you take the top route which takes you right next to it (so try and take the bottom route).  The second room is very similar to the first, except it contains a "monster" which bounces around the top right corner.  Destroy the monster quickly and move to the final room.[CR]The final room is one of the most difficult areas of the game.  To reach "The End" you must maneuver past three bouncing balls that are blocking the entrances to the small inner room.  Thankfully you can shoot these balls if it looks like you're about to crash, but lining up a shot can be difficult since you're still moving at a high rate of speed.  Once you make it inside you've got one last ball to deal with before you can reach the end of the level.  After touching the finish line you will begin a new and more difficult level.[CR]It's unknown why Looping was never released since it seems to be finished and was even advertised.  One reason may be the high difficulty of the game which really takes away most of the fun.  Difficulty aside, Looping would have made an excellent addition to the 2600 library, and is one of the best Coleco games overall.  It appears that Coleco was finally learning after several titles of questionable quality (Donkey Kong anyone?).[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/looping/looping.htm</plot>

    <plot>The Lord of the Rings: Journey to Rivendell has been the subject of speculation for many years by Atari collectors. Now one of the most sought-after Atari 2600 prototypes is finally available. What's the story, you ask?[CR]Way back in 1983 Parker Brothers featured this game in one of their catalogs. Video game and Tolkien fans alike were excited by this announcement, but the wait would be in vain. Lord of the Rings was never released, and Parker Brothers reportedly informed people that called and asked for the game that it was sold out in an attempt to cover up for the fact that it was never published.</plot>

    <plot>M.A.D. (which stands for Missile Attack and Defense) is an arcade action game somewhat similar to Missile Command. You control a photon cannon at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to protect six energy stations located to your left and right. Waves of rockets and other ships will fly by on the screen, and occasionally one will drop in an attempt to destroy one of the stations (as a warning on most levels, the enemy will turn white just before it drops). You need to make sure you shoot it before your energy station is destroyed! When all six energy stations are gone, the game is over. A two player variation is also included; one player will control the photon cannon, and the second player controls a cursor and can select when and where an enemy will drop. The players alternate between offense and defense in this version.</plot>

    <plot>You've been piloting your chopper low through the trees, picking up wounded and rushing them back to the 4077th MASH unit. There was enemy fire all around you, and you're still shaking like a leaf. You'd like to rest now, but time is running out for the soldiers you've rescued. There's no way around it. The pressure is on. You'll have to operate. And it's going to take a steady hand and a hawk eye.</plot>

You have 15 seconds to catch the first creature and take his key. Then quickly try to open one of the doors, as the creatures will chase you until you return to your safe compartment and the Malagai become shy again.

    <plot>Mangia's gameplay has been described as "bizarre."[citation needed] The player gets to control a young boy, who must eat plates of pasta placed in front of him by his mother, who will keep feeding him until his stomach explodes on-screen.[3][CR]To prevent this, the player can, instead of eating the pasta, throw it to a cat, who occasionally appears at the window, and a dog, who walks across the bottom of the screen. However, if the mother sees the pasta being thrown to the cat or dog, she brings three times as much pasta the next time she returns.[3][CR]The joystick is used to control the player: pressing right causes the boy to grab a plate of pasta, pressing left causes him to eat it, and pressing up or down causes him to toss the pasta to the cat (named Frankie in the manual) or the dog (named Sergio) respectively. If the cat and dog are not nearby when the food is thrown to them, the mother returns with extra pasta to "punish" the player. The fire button is not used.[3][CR]If, instead of eating the pasta or throwing it to the animals, the player is idle, the pasta will accumulate on the table until it breaks, causing the player to lose a turn. Attempting to eat all the pasta without giving any to the cat or dog will cause the boy's stomach to swell, changing colors from blue to yellow to red, before finally exploding in a mass of chunky blue pixels.[3]</plot>

    <plot>You've landed on an alien planet and penetrated the enemy base defended by armed attack robots. Your mission is to find your way to the heart of the base and to destroy the power center of the enemy's weapon system.[CR]You start on the right side of a room, randomly selected. You must make your way though various rooms, killing or avoiding the four robots as you go. You need to find the power center and shoot it to clear that level. You must do this before the timer at the bottom runs out. Once you shoot the power center, you will get the remaining time as bonus. You are then sent to a new room to start again but now there are five robots per room. Get the power center again and there will be six per room. Get the power center again and you return to four robots per room but faster. In some rooms, you will randomly find a magic armor that will make you invulnerable for a short time.</plot>

As the building gets higher, the kid will steal the ladder. When the brat appears on the screen, you must get off the ladder or you will fall and lose one life. When the building gets to be several stories high, you must be leery of staying on the very top as lightning may strike and lose you a life. When you lose a life, you drop any bricks you were carrying.[CR]Once the building is complete, you go all the way up the ladder and push up to call the helicopter to take you to the next site. If the building is not correct, the helicopter will pick you up but then drop you near the edge of the screen, losing you a life. There are game selections for unlimited time but limited bricks and unlimited bricks but limited time.</plot>

    <plot>You are a member of MegaForce and have been sent to the city of Sardoun. Sardoun is under attack and you must defend it. You are armed with the Moto-Fighter, a sort of armed motorcycle with flight ability.[CR]When you are on the ground, your missiles fire down and forward, at an angle. When you are in the air, your missiles fire straight ahead.[CR]The object is to destroy enemy fighters, destroy or avoid ground-launched rockets, destroy fuel depots and destroy the enemy headquarters. Any enemy fighters that get past you will head to Sardoun and bomb a building. You will see a red flash at the top of the screen with the words "Defend" when Sardoun is in trouble.[CR]Every second you are playing, you use one gallon on fuel. If you run out of fuel, you lose a life. You can shoot fuel tanks to replenish. If you destroy all the tanks of that depot, a prize will appear that you can shoot (but may not want to). See "Prizes" for details. Each tank destroyed is worth eighty points and ten gallons of fuel.</plot>

    <genre>Action</genre>
    <plot>Not to be confused with the Atari game by the same name (which was released for the 7800), Meltdown was one of the final 20th Century Fox titles to be developed (Crash Dive was the absolute last) but was never released.  Why TCF decided to cancel Meltdown is unknown, but was most likely due to the collapsing video game market.  The decision to cancel the game must have been made at the last moment, as advertisements proudly boasting "Just Released" had already been printed.  Although Meltdown was displayed at the 1983 CES show, it was never seen again after the show closed.  Long thought lost, Meltdown surfaced in a resale shop in 2004 where by chance it was discovered by a passing collector.  [CR]Meltdown is basically a game of hide and seek that place on a 4x4 grid of atoms.  At the start of each round you will see a rogue quark move about the reactor agitating the atoms.  Each time the quark touches one of atoms it will strip off some of the electrons and atom will shrink.  Once an atom has lost all it's electrons it will become unstable, if all the atoms destabilize the reactor will blow![CR]As the only remaining scientist, it is up to you to destroy the quarks and cool down the reactor.   To accomplish this you will have to make use of the only two tools at your disposal: an atomic stabilizer and Cadmium rods.  When the quark jumps to an atom you must line up the stabilizer (on the X axis), line up the Cadmium tube (on the Y axis), and quickly insert a Cadmium rod by pressing the fire button.  However as soon as you destroy one quark another one appears to take its place, so be vigilant and don't let your guard down for a moment.  [CR]The core temperature is represented by a bar displayed at the top of the screen.  As the core cools down, the bar will grow longer, once the bar reaches the center of the screen the reactor will come back under control and the reactor will be saved (for the moment).  Each time you successfully save the reactor the action will get more intense; the number of quarks will multiply, they will begin to move faster, and the electrons will strip off more easily.  Once you reach the 10,000 mark, missing even one quark will likely blow the reactor.[CR]Meltdown is an simple, yet amazingly addictive game.  It's interesting graphical style and progressive difficulty ramping makes Meltdown a game that's hard to put down.  It's a shame that 20th Century Fox never released Meltdown, as it is one of their better titles.  Like many TCF games, Meltdown was not developed by Fox themselves, but rather by a small company called Videa.  Videa eventually became Sente Technologies before being acquired by Bally and becoming the well known Bally Sente. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/meltdown/meltdown.htm</plot>

    <plot>Midnight Magic utilized the Atari 2600 joystick for performing simulated pinball functions, such as activating the flippers and shooting the ball. Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. Hitting all five drop targets at the top of the table increases the bonus multiplier (2x, 3x, and so on). Extra balls can be earned when hitting the rollover targets at the top left and right corners of the table when the bonus multiplier is activated.</plot>

When hit, everything on the screen scrolls down one row.[CR]Dragonfly: drops mushrooms while zigzagging down, and can be destroyed with a single shot.[CR]Mosquito: bounces off the sides of the screen as it descends. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls up one row.[CR]DDT bomb (stationary): can be blown up with one shot, destroying all enemies and mushrooms within the blast radius. Whenever the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen. Up to four bombs can be in play at one time.[CR]All flowers and poisoned/partially destroyed mushrooms revert to normal, whole mushrooms when the player loses a life.</plot>

    <plot>A game based on ESP?  Yes you heard me right, Mind Maze is the first (and only) Atari game to be based on the unproven (yet still popular) theory of ESP (Extra Sensory Perception).  It appears Atari was attempting to develop a sort of "Mind Reading" game for its new Mindlink controller.  So can the 2600 really read your thoughts?  Read on to find out...[CR]Mind Maze is played somewhat like those old mind reading experiments where a scientist would hold up a card and ask a person to tell him what was on the other side.  Depending on the game selected, two to four cards appear on the screen each round.  The player then must try and guess the "correct" card by highlighting it (using the joystick) and pressing the fire button.  Unfortunately this is where the game begins to fall apart.  As you've probably guessed the theory of ESP is pretty far fetched, and the odds that the player can continually guess the correct card is slim.  So the player must simply sit there and randomly select cards until he by chance selects the correct one.  Predictably, this gets boring very fast... [CR]After choosing a card all but one of the card pictures will disappear, and the computer will then highlight the "correct" card on the screen.  If the player is playing with the "Race" option, the game will show a solid blue screen and wait for the player to press a button before continuing to the next round.  This blue screen (which would have been spruced up for the final release) was probably there to allow the other player to get ready for his turn.  However since there is no two player option in this version, it doesn't really serve any point.  The player may also "pass" on the current set of cards by pressing the button without selecting a card.  This will cause a new set of cards to appear but it will still be the players turn.  There doesn't seem to be a limit on the number of times you can pass, but the game will not advance until the player picks a card. [CR]The current score is shown at the bottom of the screen.  The left digit appears to be the players score, while the right digit counts the number of rounds played.  When the player reaches 20 points they win the game and are returned to the main screen.  By setting the right difficulty switch to B, the player can activate the "Cheat" mode.  When the cheat mode is activated selecting any card will score the player points (thus making the game completely pointless).  When the switch is put back in A position the scoring is set back to normal (as normal as scoring gets in this game anyway).  The cheat mode was probably put in by the programmer to help the ESP challenged debug the game. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/mindmaze/mindmaze.htm</plot>

If he can assemble a large enough robot army, he can battle the aliens to fight his way down to deeper levels of the mine and even destroy the alien command center at the lowest level.

    <plot>Miss Piggy's Wedding was a two-player game created in 1983 for the Atari 2600 console. The game was advertised in Atari catalogs, but never made it to final release, due to Atari's cancellation of their Children's series. A prototype of the game was discovered in the late '90s by a private collector.[CR]The object of the game was for one player to maneuver Kermit through the church and outside to a waiting taxi, without getting caught by Miss Piggy (controlled by the second player), who insisted that they be married.[CR]The obstacles to Kermit were the wedding guests (represented by blocks in the picture), who try to impede his progress through the maze. He also must touch a key in order to open the doors and escape, although if Miss Piggy touches the key, the doors close again.[CR]The most complete version currently known for this game was never finished, so the consequences of Kermit escaping or being caught by Miss Piggy are unknown. Additionally, Gonzo appears at the top of the screen as the minister, yet he has no purpose in the game prototype.</plot>

    <plot>The game is played by moving a crosshair across the sky background  and launch a counter-missile from the appropriate battery. Counter-missiles explode upon reaching the crosshair, leaving a fireball that persists for several seconds and destroys any enemy missiles that enter it. There are three batteries, each with ten missiles; a missile battery becomes useless when all its missiles are fired, or if the battery is destroyed by enemy fire. The missiles of the central battery fly to their targets at much greater speed; only these missiles can effectively kill a smart bomb at a distance.</plot>

    <plot>Missile Control is a Missile Command-style game. The player has to defend their cities from incoming bombs fire by alien spaceships.[CR]The player controls a cursor on the screen which indicates the direction of fire for the defense missiles. Once launched, they travel in a straight line from the launcher through the point the player specified until they hit an object. Each level is won by destroying all alien spaceships. The player loses once all their cities are destroyed. Bonus cities can be obtained by destroying a sufficient number of alien spacecraft.[CR]The game gets progressively harder, for example bombs will fall faster and energy barriers might protect the aliens from the player's attacks. To get around the barriers, players can deflect their shots from large defense missiles launched at the sides of the screen.</plot>

    <plot>In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</plot>

    <plot>Motocross is a motorcycle racing game viewed from a top-down perspective. The player rides a bike against an endless number of opponents on a straight road, trying to avoid running into them. In addition, the player has to watch the amount of gas left in the tank. The fuel gauge can be restored by driving over fuel cans. The goal of the game is to overtake a specified amount of bikes. Once this is accomplished, a new "scene" starts, and the difficulty is increased.</plot>

    <plot>Bone-jarring off-road motorcycle racing in three events. You first must qualify in the Desert Scramble where you race across the desert avoiding the prickly cactus, desert creatures, rocks, etc., in a race of speed and time. Hit an object and your dirt bike slows down. Hit too many and you won't qualify for the next race. The Hill Climb is a torturous race up a switchback mountain full of obstacles. Speed is important but control is vital or you'll be out of the race. Qualify with a fast time and you're in the Beach Sprint against other qualifiers in an all-out dash for the championship.</plot>

    <plot>It's dinnertime, and you're simply starving.  What you would do for a nice hunk of cheese!  A slice of old-fashioned Swiss would be nice, or, even better, a morsel of Camembert.  Mmmmm.[CR]Dreaming of cheese won't get you anywhere.  You're going to have to earn your lunch.  As a hungry but clever mouse, you'll have to chomp your way through a maze of corridors and doors, while avoiding starving cats who want nothing better than to eat you.  But those feline fanatics aren't as crafty as you are.  You can outrun them.  You can confuse them by opening and shutting trapdoors.  And, with a stash of bones in reserve, you can fool these furry menaces by turning into a cat-biting dog![CR]And the race is on!</plot>

    <plot>You control Mr. Do has he tries to harvest all of the cherries on the screen. However, there are numerous bad guys out to get him! Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.</plot>

    <plot>The gameplay of Ms. Pac-Man is largely identical to that of the original Pac-Man. The player gathers points by eating dots and avoiding ghosts (contact with one loses a life). Power-pellets or energizers change the ghosts, which reverse their course and can be eaten for bonus points. Fruit bonuses can be consumed for increasing point values, twice per level. As the levels increase, the speed and difficulty increase as well.</plot>

    <plot>Night Driver is an action racing game which takes place at night! Your goal is to score as many points as possible by racing through one of four different tracks. Points are scored by passing checkpoints located throughout the track. If your car crashes into the side of the road, oncoming cars, or any other obstacles, you will lose all of your speed and a lot of time! The game ends when the 90 second time limit is up. The four tracks you can choose from are beginner, pro, expert, and random (this track is different every time and can not be memorized like the other three). Several game options are included which allows you to select whether or not other cars will honk before entering the screen, and choose between a 90 second or infinite amount of time for a game.</plot>

    <plot>Jason has taken the Golden Fleece from the gods! They are naturally upset and have imprisoned Jason in the Temple of Aphrodite with deadly Furies running overhead. You control Jason and your goal is to eliminate all of the Furies to move on to the next level. The Furies can be destroyed if they are hit with a magical brick from the roof of the temple. You are armed with an unlimited supply of stones, throwing a stone at the roof will cause a brick to fall (be careful, you'll lose a life if you hit yourself with a falling brick instead of the Furies). When a Fury is hit by a brick it is destroyed, but if you accidentally hit a Fury with a stone then it will multiply! The Furies will also be firing at you, and if you'll lose a life if hit. The game ends when you have no more lives left in reserve. Several difficulty levels are available.</plot>

    <plot>The objective of the game is to help Asterix "stun" Roman soldiers (simply by running into them, and they turn white from blue) while you command good ol'Obelix to throws his oversized Menhirs down at stunned Romans with a splat.[CR]If by any chance a stunned soldier is not whacked by a flying menhir, they turn "red" and hostile, which means Asterix is in trouble. In any case, he needs some good ol' magic potion from Getafix in order to defeat the "red" Romans, so be ready to catch some when Getafix comes knocking.[CR]There are 2 types of Roman soldiers to thump: the fat legionnaires and the small centurions. Centurions are worth more points.</plot>

In the game, Lu receives several power-ups to achieve his goal, and he must overcome a bat that stands in his way.[CR]Atari later released another Breakout clone into video arcades, also called Off the Wall.[CR]Off the Wall was made available on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs on December 1, 2010.</plot>

Unfortunately, an unsavory character named Bigelow B. Wolf was into blowing them down. It was a real drag. Until now. Because, lo and behold, today we've got Oink! A video game that lets you lend those little guys a hand. It's wacky, it's wily. It's one heck of a way to block that bully's every breath.

    <plot>Open, Sesame! is an action platform game. You control Ali Baba, and your goal is to reach the cave of treasures. The treasury entrance is at the top of the screen, and you begin each level at the bottom and need to climb your way up. To do so, you will need to find a good location where you can throw a rope up to the next platform and climb up (there will be a dot on the platform where you can safely throw a rope, two on each floor). Before the treasury can be entered, you need to attach ropes to each of the possible locations. To hinder your progress, there are guards wandering each of the floors. If you're caught, you'll lose a life! To help out, a magic ball will appear on screen from time to time; if caught, this can be used to temporarily freeze a guard. When you successfully enter the treasury, you then move on to the next level of gameplay.</plot>

    <plot>You'll need strategy, foresight and cunning to be a success at this game.[CR]The field is made up of a grid containing 64 squares.  Each player is designated by a color(white or black) and takes turns trying to capture as many squares as possible.  When you capture a square, it becomes your square and changes to your color.  Your corresponding score is displayed at the top of the screen.[CR]To capture a square, you must OUTFLANK your opponent.  To do this, you must position your squares on the grid so that one or more of your opponent's squares is in a row which is bordered on each end by one of your squares.[CR]If neither player can make a move the game is over.  This can occur when one player has no pieces left on the board.  It is also possible to end a game when there are blank squares on the board and both players have pieces left but there are no legal moves.</plot>

Once you get somewhere, you will appear in a new environment, is a cave, forest or open field. Your goal will go through the obstacles and dodge the enemies to get your bamboo.To catch a bamboo player will recover your energy and get points. If you run out points or lose your three lives, the game will end.Apparently Panda Chase is not a prototype, the game was finished and sold, which does not justify the graphics and several bugs that happen in the game.</plot>

    <plot>rachute (aka Von Himmel durch die Hoelle) is a video game released in 1983 by Homevision for the Atari 2600. The game puts the player in the role of parachutist who is falling gently from the sky. In order to land safely, the player must evade aeroplanes, helicopters, birds and hot air balloons. After successfully navigating several screens that progressively increase in speed, the parachutist finally emerges near ground level. In order to achieve a safe landing, the player must simultaneously avoid touching the pacing guard at the bottom while positioning the parachuter on the ground. A higher point bonus is awarded if the parachuter lands near the center of the screen. After landing, the game begins again at an increased difficulty level.</plot>

    <plot>In Phantom-Panzer, the player takes control of an assault vehicle in order to defend their energy base at the bottom of the screen from the attacking phantom tanks. The game consists of three phases- the first phase takes place in a city and looks like a maze. It offers relative protection with the building walls. The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there's practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it's an all-out battle with the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player's base and no obstacles to stop them. The player can only shoot one bullet at a time and has to destroy 20 tanks in each stage. Enemy bullets can be canceled by hitting them with one's own bullet. The player loses one life if they collide with one of the tanks or the enemy bullets. The game is over immediately, however, if an enemy tank or shell hits the player's energy base</plot>

    <plot>Phoenix is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You are the commander of the Phoenix, and your mission is to reach an alien spaceship which has been draining your planets resources. The ship is guarded by four levels of bird like creatures. After clearing all four stages, the fifth level will be against a large, heavily shielded mothership. If the mothership is destroyed, the game will then repeat, but with increased speed and difficulty. To defeat the numerous enemies, the Phoenix is equipped with a laser cannon and a force field.</plot>

By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear.</plot>

Then you can head over to the Love Nest Hotel to really score![CR]You start with your lover of a pedestal on the left and various items floating above you. You must shoot each item once to acquire it. If an item starts flashing, shoot it next because after a short time, you'll lose a chance. If you shoot an item a second time, you will lose it and a chance. Lose all your chances and the game is over. If you collect all the items needed, head over to the pedestal then head off the screen to the right. Head to the door of the hotel and the hotel sign will say how many times you have scored. Now head left to start the next level.</plot>

    <plot>Piece Of Cake? - no way! So you thought your first day on the job was going to be easy? Well, you not only have to learn the fine art of baking cakes, but you also have to master it in a big hurry. It's actually a very simple job - at first. You simply take a freshly baked cake from the oven and drop it on a platter which is moving on a conveyor belt. Top that with a cherry, and you will be rewarded for your artistic endeavors. You must stack them correctly however, or - splat! As your skill progresses, so does the conveyor speed, so keep your cool and try not to earn the dubious title of 'butterfingers.'</plot>

    <plot>Now it's time for...PIIIIIIGS IN SPAAAAACE!!!This game is really three smaller games. You select what to play to choosing which character you want.For Captain Link Hogthrob, it is Chickenvaders. A Pigs in Space take in Atari's Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders.While exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space chickens. Captain Link must destroy them before they make their way all the way to the planet. He does this by firing link sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken! You also lose a life. From time to time, Gonzo flies across the screen top in his saucer. You can hit him for points also.ScoringHitting a chicken on...Row one=10 pointsRow two=20 pointsRow three=50 pointsRow four=70 pointsRow five=100 pointsHitting Gonzo=300 pointsDestroying all the chickens=1000 point bonusIf you select First Mate Piggy, you play Pastaroids. Somehow, Piggy has been ejected from the Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the bottom of the screen to the top and board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will lose ground, and thus time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't dawdle.ScoringKarate-chopping a meat ball=100 pointsBoarding the Swinetrek=1000 pointsIf you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The Swinetrek has gotten trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The Gonzoids are standing on ledges, throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the Boomeray. When you fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life.ScoringYou get one point for every mile you get through the mine.Hitting a Gonzoid=100 pointsEscaping the mine=1000 pointsThe difficulty switches do nothing. The only game selections are one player or two player, alternating.</plot>

    <plot>You control Pitfall Harry as he makes his way through an underground Peruvian cave in search of the valuable Raj diamond, as well as his lost niece and cat. Once all three have been found, the game is over. The gameplay is fundamentally the same as Pitfall!, but with a few new twists. The environments are no longer limited to a horizontal plane, so navigating through the complex maze of corridors becomes a matter of puzzle solving and timing. Harry has also gained the abilities to swim and float across chasms using a balloon. The scorpions make a return appearance, but there are many new creatures for Harry to avoid, such as frogs, bats, electric eels, and condors.</plot>

Don't be nervous; I'll be your guide through the jungle, and I'm one of the best. Untold riches are waiting for us in there, but so are dangers a dozen times over. We'll be swinging on vines over bottomless tarpits. We'll be hopping across swamps, using crocodile heads like stepping stones. We'll be searching underground through dark passageways crawling with killer scorpions. So pack up your backpack and meet me at the jungle at dawn - and we'll be off to seek a king's ransom in gold, diamonds and lost treasures - in Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure.</plot>

Your assignment takes you from daylight to night missions and in your encounters you have to rescue downed pilots. Periodically you have to make refueling stops. The graphics are true to life. Planet Patrol is destined to become a universal hit!</plot>

    <plot>Talk about suffering from an identity crisis, for years Planet of the Ape had been misidentified as another 20th Century Fox prototype called Alligator People.  This was because the first PotA prototype was found in case labeled Alligator People, and since no screenshots of either game existed there was no reason to doubt the name on the label.  However after much research it was discovered (by yours truly) that this game was in fact really John Marvin's lost Planet of the Apes game.  So why was Planet of the Apes found in a case labeled Alligator People?  While no one knows for sure, it's assumed that this prototype was simply put into the wrong case (they probably just used an old case they had lying around).  [CR]You play the role Col. George Taylor (who looks a bit like Pitfall Harry's long lost brother).  Your mission is to guide Col. Taylor through a series of screens as he avoids an army of apes and makes his way towards the Forbidden Zone.  There are three different kinds of apes in this game, and they all move in a straight line across the screen from right to left.[CR]Chimpanzees - These little guys are harmless and can be touched without fear.  Shooting them is worth 3 points.[CR]Orangutans - Orangutans are a bit bigger and a lot more dangerous than the Chimpanzees.  Touching them will get you captured and cost you 1 life unit.  Shooting a Chimpanzee is worth 200 points.  [CR]Gorillas - Gorillas are the most dangerous of all the apes.  Not only can they capture you, but they can shoot at you as well.  Being shot will cost you 2 life units and shooting them is worth only 42 points![CR]At the top of the screen you see two counters, L and E.  L is your Life counter, you start with 60 life points and if you lose them all the game ends.  The E is your Escape counter, this is the number of times you can escape from the cage or pit.  If you run out of escapes your character will be trapped forever (effectively ending the game).[CR]The Forest[CR]You start out in a forest with several apes after you.  You can shoot at the apes by pressing the fire button, but since they just keep on coming its best to run for it.  There are also pits scattered throughout the forest, falling into one of these pits will cause your life to deplete rapidly.  Thankfully you can press the fire button to get out, but it will cost you one of your Escapes.  While you can run in any direction, only moving south will advance you towards your goal.  Moving south three times will bring you to the river.   [CR]The River[CR]Unlike other sections of this game, the river is only one screen wide.  Once again you can move any direction, but only going south will bring you towards the Forbidden Zone.  Touching the river isn't deadly, and you can move through without any trouble.  As you move through the river you'll notice that your guy appears to be flailing about with his arms in the air like he's drowning.  This may be because the river was going to be deadly and a bridge put across it, but since this is an early prototype we'll assume your guy is just a poor swimmer and move on.[CR]The Village[CR]If you touched an Orangutan or a Gorilla then you'll end up here.  You can escape from the cage by pressing the fire button, but it will cost you one of your Escapes.  You need to be extra careful in the village since the area is cramped, and there are lots of apes roaming around.  It's very easy to escape and be captured again right away.  You'll also want to escape from the cage as quickly as possible since the apes will constantly hit you while your trapped in the cage.  Moving south three times will bring you to the desert.[CR]The Desert[CR]After the river you'll encounter a large featureless desert which is the beginning of the Forbidden Zone.  There are more apes here than in any other part of the game, so you'll have to be on your guard.  Each desert board looks exactly alike except for a slight change in color, so its easy to get lost.  If you haven't been caught, moving south nine times will bring you to the caverns.  If you came by way of the village (you were captured), you only need to move south six times to reach the caves.[CR]The Caverns[CR]These have to be the funkiest looking caverns I've ever seen.  The cavern walls are rainbow colored making your journey extra trippy.  There are no apes to worry about in the caverns, but they are unfortunately a giant maze.  You'll also slowly loose life points as you traverse the caves at the rate of 1 point every 5 seconds.  There are two paths out of the caves: If you got captured at least once you to move south once, left once, and south again, but if you took the long way you need to move south once, left once, and south twice to reach your goal.  If you take the wrong path through the caves you'll end up back on the forest screen.  There are other paths out of the caves, but these work every time.[CR]The Statue of Liberty[CR]This is the goal you've been trying to reach.  It's a little hard to make out, but the picture is of the Statue of Liberty's torch and head.  Once you reach this the screen will begin to flash and you'll see the Statue of Liberty displayed while the background scrolls through all the boards you've crossed.  After this strange scene you'll gain 10 life points, 1 extra Escape, and 1200 bonus points.  You will now start back at the forest screen on the next higher difficulty level. [CR]Each new difficulty level has a few changes:[CR]The apes will do an extra point of damage when they shoot you.[CR]The apes move faster.[CR]More apes appear on the screen at once and come out more often.[CR]The bonus points for reaching the Statue of Liberty increases by 100.[CR]It's obvious that Planet of the Apes still has some work to be done, but was finished enough to go through initial playtesting.  Before programmer John Marvin could finish it he left 20th Century Fox to go work for Epyx.  Since 20th Century Fox closed down its video game unit three months later Planet of the Apes was never completed.

    <plot>This is a sequel to Phoenix. [CR]On the first screen, you must shoot swooping aliens while not getting shot by them. At some point, an alien will create a shield across the screen just above your ship that will require you to shoot holes through to destroy more aliens. Be aware, however, that the alien shots are not slowed at all and can still kill you.[CR]On the second screen, you must shoot or avoid a phoenix(es) shots but the object is to shoot the alien in  the mothership above. You can also shoot the phoenix(es) themselves for points.[CR]On the third screen, you must maneuver between parked ships, without hitting any, to dock at your spot at the top. Once you do this, the game goes to the first screen only harder.[CR]There are game selections to choose to also play only the first, second or third screens, with each wave getting harder.</plot>

    <plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Programmed by Carol Shaw, Polo is a game for the Atari 2600 based on the sport of the same name. It was originally designed to be a tie-in for Ralph Lauren's Polo cologne. The plan was to have the game set up on Atari 2600 consoles that were located within New York City's Bloomingdale's department store. However, the promotion never ended up seeing the light of day, and thus, the game was shelved.Despite this, a version of the game's prototype was released on the compilation disc, 'Stella Gets a New Brain' in 1996. As well as this, a standalone version of the game was released in 2002 by Cassidy Nolen during the PhillyClassic 3 game convention.</plot>

    <plot>You choose from five different cases to work, each with its own requirements. For example, the first case, "Safecracker Suite," requires you to locate the gun used in a crime and have it verified at the gun store, then locate stolen money and return it to the bank and then capture Henri Le Fiend and turn him into the police station. You have only a limited amount of time before the statute of limitations runs out and Henri Le Fiend gets away.[CR]Hindering your investigation are a number of obstacles, including potholes, falling objects, unfriendly animals, and knife-throwing thugs, to name a few.[CR]You drive around the city in your modified 1935 Model A, which can jump as high as two stories. It can also make 90 and 180 degree turns on a dime. When you make the car jump, you also launch yourself out of it, enabling you to nab suspects in upper story windows.</plot>

    <plot>Q bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off the board while Q bert is safely transported to the top.</plot>

    <plot>Player one controls a kangaroo, while the squirrel is controlled by another player, or a computerized opponent. The object of the game is to score the most points before losing every life.[CR]The playfield consists of multiple "trampolines"; bars of color which can be jumped on by either player. A grey trampoline scores no points, a pink one scores five. Additionally, jumping on a pink trampoline turns it to the player's color. Players continue jumping on to trampolines, turning them their respective color, until an alarm signals the end of a stage. At this point, the next screen scrolls down vertically, and trampolines score points as they scroll off the bottom of the screen. It is therefore the object to end the stage with as many trampolines as possible turned to the respective colors of the players.[CR]Additionally, there are "tricky trap" trampolines (6 in total) where a player can use the lone button on the atari joystick to remove a trampoline altogether. The disappearing trampoline would be the one most recently jumped on. A magic hat is occasionally up for grabs as well. capturing the hat and touching an opponent while on a trampoline causes that opponent to temporarily freeze, giving an advantage to the player with the hat. Gold mats are worth additional points, and award one additional tricky trap for a maximum of 7.[CR]Each player has 6 lives, with a bonus life at 2000 points. The surviving player gains 200 points per remaining life (and is awarded a bonus life if the remaining life bonus puts that player over 2000).</plot>

    <plot>You are a rabbit who is just trying to get to where you can get a mate and make like a mathematician by multiplying. First you must get through the meadow and across the ledges without losing life and limb.[CR]You start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game starts back at the beginning, but more difficult this time!</plot>

    <plot>White water everywhere! And hidden in the strong current are any number of dangers lying in wait to capsize your log raft. Your mission is to make your way downstream as far as possible, avoiding treacherous rocks, feisty moose, and sections of tree which have been cut down by a pesky beaver. Skillful maneuvering is not without rewards, however, because there are also gold nuggets appearing in the river, which, when touched, can be accumulated to extend your trek into the wilderness.</plot>

    <plot>Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!</plot>

The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets).

    <plot>Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</plot>

    <plot>Join the Atari Aces in the World Series of video baseball--RealSports BASEBALL!  It's a hot day in the ballpark--you can see the hot dog and soda pop vendors making their way up and down the bleachers.  The crowd roars after each pitch, and filling the stadium is the sound of "STEERIKE!  YOU'RE OUT!" Down on the field it's a different story--just you and the pitcher facing each other in an enormous diamond of brown and green.[CR]The roar of the spectators fades into the distance as the pitcher winds up. His arm arches back, his leg goes up, and...THUNK!  The ball flashes by and hits the catcher's glove at 90 miles an hour.  "STEERIKE!"  Another windup, another 90 mile an hour fastball, and "STEERIKE TWO!"  Gripping the bat tightly, you stare down at the pitcher, see him wind up, and watch as the ball seems to float in slow motion down the field toward you.  Everything falls into place as you swing with perfect timing, feel the contact, and see the ball sail over the right fielders outstretched glove and over the wall.  HOME RUN!</plot>

Enter the squared circle to face off against a friend or a computer-controlled opponent.

    <plot>RealSports Football is a one or two-player football simulation played on a horizontal scrolling field, with five players on each team. As in real football, the goal is to march down a 100-yard field using a combination of passing and running plays. There are three ways to score: crossing the defensive team's goal line is a touchdown worth seven points, kicking the ball through the defense's goal post is a field goal worth three points, and tackling the ball carrier inside the end zone is a safety worth two points.</plot>

You can choose from one of 12 different games, and play either solo or against a friend as you pass and shoot your way to victory (or defeat).[CR]Each team has three players with a specific area of the field to cover. A game lasts five or nine minutes and can be played on one of three difficulty levels, with each increasing the speed of gameplay and skill of the computer players.</plot>

    <plot>RealSports Volleyball for the Atari VCS does a nice job simulating two-on-two beach volleyball, complete with ocean view, a setting sun, and a roaming shark. The computer players are challenging, and trying to line up a player under the ball's shadow can be tricky. However, two drawbacks somewhat diminish gameplay: both players must be controlled simultaneously, meaning sometimes neither player can quite reach the ball; and players can't jump to block a spike.</plot>

    <plot>We have a serious problem on Terra I. The colonies sole purpose is to mine Zenbar Crystals which are used for 72% of Earth's energy production. Mining dangers plus security needed to safeguard crystal shipments required the creation of the most complex computer-controlled robotics system ever devised. This system had been doing a tremendous job. But... something is wrong. Crystal shipments have stopped, and returning crystal freighters have been destroyed by Terra I's own planetary defense system...</plot>

    <plot>River Patrol is a 1981 arcade game released by Orca and licensed to Kestern for distribution in the United States. A port was released for the Atari 2600 by Tigervision in 1984.[CR]Players take the role of the captain of a river patrol ship in this top-down game. Their mission: to save the poor souls who fell into the river by running them over with the patrol ship. In the ship's way lay boulders, crocodiles, and floating logs, all waiting to sink the vessel. The ship also sinks if it does not reach the dam before a time limit expires.[CR]There are 99 levels and it takes approximately 3 hours to complete. Once you have completed the game, your patrol boat crashes into the wall of the dam.</plot>

    <plot>Imagine yourself as the Road Runner in a Saturday morning cartoon. You are happily whizzing across the desert, racing along that black ribbon of highway. But that cunning Wile E. Coyote is out there somewhere. He is planning to smash you to smithereens! He is also scheming to blast you with his Acme cannon in a very sneaky way. As you run down the highway there are piles of bird seed to peck at. Each pile of seed gives you extra points. But, old Wile E. Coyote is up to his usual tricks... he sets up piles of steel shot. If you eat the steel shot, you will be an easy catch for that nasty coyote and his Acme magnet.</plot>

    <plot>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path! Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</plot>

    <plot>Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides. Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points.</plot>

    <plot>As 2002 was quietly winding down, an announcement was made that took the collecting community off guard.  Long time collector David Winter announced that he had discovered a previously unknown prototype, which appeared to simulate a 3-D Rubik's Cube.  Unfortunately since the prototype had no labels we can't be sure what the actual name is, but all available evidence suggests that it was simply called Rubik's Cube.  So to keep from confusing it with the Rubik's Cube cart Atari did release, we'll call this one 3-D Rubik's Cube. [CR]3-D Rubik's Cube appears to have been in development around the same time as Atari Video Cube as both have a 1982 copyright.  Why Atari would go with the bland "one-side-at-a-time" version when they had this amazing 3-D version is unknown, but there may have been copyright or licensing issues that forced Atari to change the look and feel of the game.  This argument is further supported by the fact that Atari renamed the game "Atari Video Cube" instead of keeping the name Rubik's Cube which is used in this prototype.  However the biggest mystery surrounds the re-release of Atari Video Cube as Rubik's Cube in 1984.  Obviously Atari finally secured the rights to the name, so why not release the 3-D version instead of simply recycling AVC?  Until the programmer for either game can be found, the world may never know.[CR]As you probably already guessed, 3-D Rubik's Cube is a computer simulation of the old Rubik's Cube puzzle that was all the rage back in the mid 80's.  Unlike Atari Video Cube, 3-D Rubik's Cube is displayed in three dimensions so the player can see three of the cube faces at once rather than one.  This makes solving the cube much easier as the player doesn't have to have a super human memory to remember the other five sides.  Since 3-D Rubik's Cube is shown in a proper 3-D perspective, players can manipulate the cube just like they would in the real world.  This is a far cry from Atari Video Cube's gameplay which involved an elf running over squares, picking up and dropping off colors (what the hell were they thinking?). [CR]3-D Rubik's Cube as two different play modes: Normal and Cheat (toggled by the left difficulty switch).  In normal mode the player can rotate the cube in any one of four directions until the desired side appears.  Once a side has been selected, the player can then rotate the individual slices (rows and columns) until they think they have it in the right position.  The player repeats this process until the cube is solved (or they go insane).  In cheat mode, the player can actually set the colors on the cube to what ever they desire.  Players can even create impossible to solve cubes by placing too much of one color or not enough of another.  Due to the strange nature of this "cheat mode", people have begun to speculate it may have been put in for debugging purposes.  It is unknown if it would have been included in the final release. [CR]As if this prototype wasn't amazing enough, 3-D Rubik's Cube even includes a solve mode.  If the player gets too frustrated they can choose to have the computer solve the cube for them (Yes the 2600 IS smarter than you!).  However players cannot activate the solve mode if the colors have been altered in cheat mode, so you'll have to put them back into their original configuration first.  This was done to prevent players from building unsolvable cubes with the cheat mode (there's always one kid who has to ruin it for everybody).  Unfortunately there is no way to automatically restore the colors, so it's up to the player to remember what they changed. The solve mode is actually a step-by-step demonstration (controlled by the fire button), and shows the player each move it is making.  This way players can learn what they did wrong and become better Rubik's Cube solvers (good luck beating those guys who solve them in 10 seconds flat).[CR]The graphics in 3-D Rubik's Cube are simply amazing. While they may have some rough jagged edges, each square on the cube is displayed at the proper angle to give a true 3-D perspective.  It is theorized that the cube is made up of a combination of playfield and character graphics, which allows multiple colored squares to be shown on the same scanline.  The sound effects are pretty standard for a puzzle game, consisting of a beep when rotating the cube, a little victory song upon solving the cube, and a nasty crashing sound when the solve mode fails (due to misuse of the cheat mode).  It's obvious that a lot of hard work went into this game[CR]The only problem with 3-D Rubik's Cube is that the game is just as tedious as the real world puzzle.  Why would players waste their time screwing around with a simulated puzzle (especially with the awkward controls) when they could just pick up the real thing?  Rubik's Cube 3-D is proof that just because you can digitize something doesn't necessarily mean you should.. [CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/3drubikscube/3drubikscube.htm</plot>

    <plot>Both a NTSC and PAL prototype version have been found and the game appears to be complete. It was originally planned to be a cassette game for the Power Module peripheral, and is one of the games designed for use with The Joyboard controller. It was later planned to be one of four games on the fifth Power Play Arcade cart. According to a press kit, this was to be a first person flying simulation with a true 'through the cockpit' viewpoint and featuring both land and sea game variations. Catalog description: 'You're guiding your plane through a routine surveillance mission when suddenly, you're surrounded by enemy bombers and fighters. But they've seen you first. And you'd better think fast. You squeeze off a few rounds, just to let them know it isn't going to be easy. You pull back hard on the stick, and head straight for the sky. It's not going to be easy for you either...'</plot>

    <plot>You are Hotot, a cybernetic life form from a serene planet in a distant galaxy. Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur.[CR]On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly.[CR]In Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt. Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you must destroy the warhead one-on-one.[CR]In the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course, the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix that will try to hold you off. If you take to log to destroy the warhead, it will escape into space. Whether you destroy it or not, you will then return to the Rocket Construction Site at a harder level.</plot>

Gameplay takes place on several different screens which have different objectives. First you will need to make your way through Sherwood Forest; numerous henchman are hiding here, so use your arrows to shoot them. Surviving the forest, the next section takes place outside of the castle; naturally, numerous henchman guard the castle gate. While dodging incoming arrows, you need to shoot enough of the henchman to cause the gate to open. Once it opens, you can enter the castle for the final scene. Inside the castle you will be able to find Maid Marian behind one of the many doors, and gold behind another. The rest of the doors have henchman hiding behind them, but if you can find the Maid Marian or the gold then you win this round and the game repeats at a tougher skill level.</plot>

    <plot>[CR]Development History[CR]Save The Whales was going to be the first of three games for the  Atari 2600 to be released by 20th Century Fox for environmental causes, with profits from the titles going to organizations to help save the environment. Profits from Save The Whales would have been donated to Green Peace. Save The Whales was finished but was not released by Fox. It was eventually released in 2002 at the Classic Gaming Expo by CGE Services Corporation. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of Save The Whales is to protect a pod of whales from a ship that will fire nets and harpoons down at the whales. Sometimes radioactive waste would float through the level and the player would have to get rid of it by shooting it.  The player must shoot the projectiles and waste without letting them hit their submarine because the player will lose a life.  The game also included difficulty switches which would change the speed of the projectiles and whether the projectiles were larger, slower, easier to shoot nets or smaller, faster harpoons. The game also had a two player mode that would allow another player to control the whaling ship.  </plot>

    <plot>The object of the game is to deploy your battleships, submarines, aircraft carriers and more from your harbors. Then strategically battle your way across the seas in an effort to gain access and infiltrate your opponent's harbors. It's a bitter fight to the end! [CR]Sea Battle was finished at M Network in the 1980’s, but never released. In 2000, Intellivision Productions released this game complete with a simple box and manual. Sea Battle is the Atari 2600 version of the Intellivision game of the same name. At one point it was called High Seas, which was consistent with M Network’s policy of changing the name of a game when it appeared on a different system.</plot>

    <plot>You command the Sea Hawk fighter plane in this military battle! Your mission is to destroy enemy helicopters and ships traveling through the battle zone. But watch out! Enemy ships will attack your Sea Hawk with ship-to-air missiles that can catch you off guard. And enemy helicopters will send a steady stream of machine gun fire your way. Winning depends on your steady hand and quick wits. If your Sea Hawk is hit, your pilot will parachute from it. But it will be up to you to save him by guiding him to one of your ships. If he lands in the ocean or on an enemy ship, he dies.</plot>

    <plot>They've given you a number and taken away your name - "Secret Agent Man" by Johnny Rivers[CR]You, the Secret Agent, must catch the falling agent items, like U.S. documents, money cases and money bags, while avoiding the undesirables, like bugs, grenades and guns. After a time, a tone will sound. This is when the boats on the water below you will stop moving and you need to get above them and 'make the hand off'. Be careful, though, for although the boats stopped moving, the falling items have not. In two-player games, the players alternate.</plot>

    <plot>It started with one station, then three, then eight. If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.[CR]You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. Each weapon inflicts different damage, and depletes a different amount of energy. As a rule, the stronger a weapon is, the more energy it requires. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring. Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.[CR]Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen. Hence, the game won't go long if you run out of energy.</plot>

    <plot>You're a scientist, and your invention, a pulsating, glowing orb called the Sentinel, absorbs and stores energy from a variety of sources. Now Earth is threatened by deadly aliens and you must use your creation to save the planet. The Sentinel absorbs energy from every power pod or energy capsule you shoot with your Atari light gun. When an energy source is hit, a beam blasts out from the Sentinel, strikes the target with hissing force, and draws energy back into your Sentinel. It's up to you to protect the Sentinel as it glides over the planets.</plot>

    <plot>Good morning, Captain. It is imperative that you complete the construction of the Space Station as soon as possible. The Shuttle is fueled and ready for liftoff. The Orbiting Factory will provide you with the last 10 sections of the space station. The Orbital Fuel Depot is standing by to provide you with additional fuel should you require it. Scanners report a hazardous debris belt at high altitude. Time is of the essence. Good luck!</plot>

    <plot>In this game, you have five minutes to get from your front steps to the steps of the school. You have to get through this maze and conquer 30 tubes and ramps AND get to the school.You start at your front steps. To get on the board, move left or right and while moving, press fire. When you are on your board, just push the direction you want to turn. Press fire to jump and press and hold fire to jump and land in a crouched position. You will also see rails, walls and hurdles but these you must avoid as they will make you crash.To jump a ramp, just ride towards it and be aligned with it. To clear a tube, ride through it while crouched. If you ride through grass, it will slow you down. To get back up to speed, either crash into something or ride through grass until you stop then get the skateboard going again.The scoreboard at the top of the screen is not an obstacle. When you get to it, you just keep going.</plot>

    <plot>Pull!  The trap springs, and the clay pigeon -- alive with flight -- soars away from you at an unexpected angle.  With a fluid motion, you raise your gun to your shoulder as you pivot toward your target.  You lead your pigeon, finger on the trigger... your mind racing... challenged by the speeding target before you.  Will your reactions be too slow?  Too fast?  Or right on course?  Suddenly you squeeze the trigger!</plot>

    <plot>To get to the place of hunting, James must go through a route of 30 km full of obstacles and dangers. As he passed the first screen, the player will pick up your gun and you will help you hit the animals that run in your direction. After passing the 30 km from the hunting area, a new level will begin, where the player must again go through the obstacles to get to the animals. Over phase the game increases its difficulty.</plot>

    <plot>In Skiing, your goal is to ski to the bottom of the mountain in the shortest time possible. The mountain is treacherous with plenty of trees and moguls in the way! There are two different modes of gameplay. In slalom mode, there are a series of gates you need to ski through; missing any will result in a penalty to your time. In downhill mode you just need to ski to the bottom as fast as possible. Each mode includes five different skill levels which affect the length of the course (and the number of gates in slalom mode.)</plot>

    <plot>Sky Diver is an action game for two players. The goal is to score the most points by jumping from a plane, opening your parachute, and guiding your sky diver safely to a landing pad. The longer you wait to open your parachute, the more points you earn for a successful landing, but don't wait too long or your chute won't open at all! For each jump, there will be varying wind conditions which blow your sky diver off course. A wind sock at the bottom of the screen will help you determine the wind speed and direction so you can compensate. There are nine jumps total, and the player with the most points at the end wins.</plot>

    <plot>A mothership drops aliens, up to three on screen at a time. There are ten per level. You must shoot them but avoid the items they fire at you. You fire by pushing up on the joystick. Pushing left or right makes you go left or right. If you hold down the button, pushing left or right makes you fire left or right. Later enemies will drop fireballs that chase you along the ground or split in two smaller enemies when shot. If you fire non-stop, you will build up heat as indicated by the green bar at the bottom right. If you overheat or are hit by an enemy, you loser a life. The game is over when you lose all lives or reach a score of 999,999. You get a new man (4 max) every 10,000 points.</plot>

    <plot>Sky Jinks is a racing game that will have you weaving through pylons, trees and balloonists in an effort to finish one of five different courses as fast as possible. A top-down view of the course shows your P-41 plane and surrounding obstacles.[CR]Use the fire button to accelerate and joystick to bank left or right as you make your way through the air. Each race differs in the amount of pylons you'll have to pass through -- red pylons require you to fly to the right, while blue pylons must be passed on the left. Missing a pylon will cost you three seconds on the clock.</plot>

    <plot>Gargamel has kidnapped Smurfette. As a Smurf, the player has to walk from the Smurf village through a forest and a cave on the way to Gargamel's castle, where Smurfette awaits rescue. The player has an energy bar that slowly depletes over time.[CR]Each side-scrolling screen presents various obstacles that the player must precisely jump over (e.g. fences, stalagmites) or land upon (e.g. ledges). Failure to execute any jump results in instant death. Higher difficulty levels introduce flying bats and spiders that the player must also avoid.[CR]The ColecoVision version of Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle contains an Easter egg. Upon reaching Smurfette's screen, the player can return to the previous screen. Just before the screen changes, it will appear as though the top of Smurfette's dress comes off, making her appear topless.</plot>

Using blue, red, yellow and white spigots, Greedy must put the same color liquid or mix liquids to get the same color in his glass. If he gets it right, he and Clumsy drink up. If he gets it wrong, the glass drains out.In Game Mode, the colors start easy and get progressively harder. In Toy Mode, the color selection in Clumsy's glass is random.There is no time limit or penalty if you get something wrong.</plot>

    <plot>The Zylons are back, and are attempting another takeover of the galaxy! Your goal is to destroy all of the Zylon fighters you encounter, rescue cadets that are trapped on Zylon planets, and to find the planet Solaris to protect it from the Zylons. Your spaceship is equipped with a galactic map which can be used to warp to different sectors of the galaxy. The map shows the location of Zylon squadrons, Zylon planets, federation starbases, wormholes, clusters of stars, and Solaris when you find it. By warping to the correct sector, you can battle the numerous types of Zylon fighters to keep them from attacking federation bases and planets. Your spaceship has a limited amount of fuel; when you see the fuel gage get too low, you will need to warp to a federation starbase to refuel (make sure you leave enough fuel to warp). When flying over a Zylon controlled planet, you will see your cadets on the surface. If you rescue all of the cadets as you fly past, you will receive bonus points and an extra spaceship. The Zylon's have many different types of fighters which you will encounter, as well as some narrow corridors with blockades which you will need to clear in order to reach new locations in the galaxy.</plot>

    <plot>Many centuries ago, the Earth was ruled by Sorcerers and Wizards. They possessed mystical powers capable of both good and evil. The most respected influences in the land were from the good Sorcerers. This fact continually disturbed the evil Wizards, and they eventually decided to use their power to conquer the countryside and enslave its people. They devised a plan to systematically eliminate the good Sorcerers by sending wave after wave of diabolical creatures to ravage the world.[CR]As the bravest of the good Sorcerers you have been asked to destroy these forces and save the planet. As a reward for your bravery: whenever you overcome or destroy a creature, you will receive a treasure.[CR]Knowing your bravery the Wizards have done everything within their power to keep you from succeeding. They don't believe you will survive their first three waves of evil, but just in case you do they have several surprises waiting, Only you can discover through bravery and talent how evil they can become.[CR]To give you more power over the Forces of Evil the good Sorcerers have provided a magical Flying Platform. When you start on your journey you should first catch this elusive platform. You can continue without it, but only the foolish would dare to do so. Once on the Flying Platform you can go anywhere on the screen to avoid or destroy the enemy. The good Sorcerers have also given you four lives to use against the Forces of Evil.</plot>

    <plot>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used.</plot>

You control a bug blaster at the bottom of the screen, and need to defend the three pieces of fruit at the top right of the screen. Various types of attacking spiders scurry around rapidly, trying to destroy your blaster and steal the fruit. If all of your fruit is stolen or you lose all of your bug blasters, the game is over. When all the spiders on a round are destroyed, you move on to the next, faster round. If you still have all three pieces of fruit when a round is completed, you receive an extra bug blaster.</plot>

    <plot>The Green Goblin has set a super bomb at the top of a high voltage tower located on the top of a skyscaper! As Spider-Man, you need to scale the building and defuse the bomb. Use your web to climb the building, but be careful of Green Goblin's villians which appear in the windows trying to stop you. If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points. When you reach the top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.</plot>

    <plot>Spike's Peak is an action game where you need to climb to the top of a mountain! Gameplay takes place on five different screens. The first screen shows you approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four different difficulty levels available.</plot>

    <plot>Talk about a game with convoluted history!  It was once thought that Spinning Fireball (along with Pizza Chef, Immies and Aggies, and A Mysterious Thief), were all unreleased games developed by a company called Zimag which may have also been known as Emag or Vidco.  However after some intense research it was discovered that these games may have been developed in Taiwan and simply patched into NTSC format.  [CR]Spinning Fireball is a half hearted attempt at a 3D target shooting game.  This is probably something that shouldn't have ever been attempted on the 2600, but Vidco decided to try it anyway.  The result is a game that looks decent, but plays horribly.  The goal of the game is to have your wizard create and shoot a fireball at the catapult that movies across the top of the screen.  [CR]The controls for Spinning Fireball are bit difficult to master, which is just as well as you probably won't want to play this game very long.  To create your fireball, simply push and hold the joystick forward.  Once the fireball starts to spin (hence the name Spinning Fireball), press the fire button to shoot it.  The direction the fireball flies is based on the direction it was spinning when the button was pressed (sort of like the hammer throw in Track and Field).  If you are facing right the fireball will rotate clockwise, otherwise if you left the fireball will rotate counterclockwise. If your shot actually manages to hit the catapult (and good luck with that), then you will be taken to the second level.  [CR]While Spinning Fireball may be short on thrills, there are some dangers you will face during your fire slinging exploits.  If your fireball hits the sides of the screen it will bounce back at you.  Likewise if you shoot your fireball straight up, it will come back down (run!).  If you manage to get hit by your wayward fireball, you will lose a life.  Also, the catapult at the top of the screen will occasionally shoot a fireball at you, as you may have guessed, being hit by this fireball will also result in losing a life.  You also have a limited amount of time to finish each level, if the timer hits zero you will (say it with me now) lose a life.  The timer starts a five minutes for the first level, and decreases one minute for each successive level (down to two minutes starting on level four). [CR]While it won't win any awards for good graphics or gameplay, Spinning Fireball is an interesting attempt to breathe some innovation into the tired old shooter formula.  Unfortunately the result was a game that needs more variety and polish before it could be considered fun to play.  The frustrating control scheme makes hitting the catapult more a matter of luck than skill. There's a reason these games never made it to the US.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/firespinner/firespinner.htm</plot>

    <plot>In this game, you are an American fighter pilot. Your mission is to shoot down enemy planes, shoot enemy ammo dumps (they look like little black houses) and enemy anti-aircraft guns (they kinda look like sundials). If you fly down too long, you will get a low altitude warning. If you don't correct, you will crash. You can also be shot down by anti-aircraft guns and enemy planes. Push left and right to go those directions but push up to go down and down to go up. Push the fire button to fire machine guns.</plot>

    <plot>In Jedi Arena, you have to face an opponent in the arena to see who is the true Jedi master. Wandering throughout the arena is a seeker which is capable of firing laser bolts. To be victorious you need to destroy your opponents shield by having the seeker fire laser bolts at it. You are armed only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well as block incoming fire from your opponent. The first player to break through the other players shield wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match! Several game options are included which control the speed of the seeker, or even make the seeker invisible.</plot>

You start the task outside the shield perimeter of the Death Star. There you'll have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the energy shield. After reaching the Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the point where you can hit the core. In the following destruction of the station you must avoid collision with Death Star debris.</plot>

    <plot>Star Wars is an arcade game produced by Atari Inc. and released in 1983.[2] The game is a first person space simulator, simulating the attack on the Death Star from the 1977 film Star Wars. The game is composed of 3D color vector graphics. This game was developed during the Golden Age of Arcade Games and is considered the #4 most popular game of all time according to the readers of Killer List of Videogames.[3][CR]The player assumes the role of Luke Skywalker ("Red Five"), as he pilots an X-wing fighter from a first-person perspective. Unlike other arcade games of similar nature, the player does not have to destroy every enemy in order to advance through the game; he must simply survive as his fighter flies through the level, which most often means he must avoid or destroy the shots that enemies fire. Each hit on his craft takes away one shield (of the six he started out with), and if he runs out of shields and takes another hit, the game ends.[CR]The player's ultimate goal is to destroy the Death Star through three attack phases.[CR]In the first phase of the game, the player begins in outer space above the Death Star. He must engage in a dog fight with Darth Vader and enemy TIE fighters.[CR]In the second phase, the player reaches the Death Star's surface as laser turrets on towers rise to confront the player. The player is awarded a bonus if they manage to destroy a certain number of turrets.[CR]In the final scenario, the player must navigate the trench of the Death Star, avoiding obstacles and gun turrets until finally firing a proton torpedo at the correct time for a direct hit on the exhaust port target. If the player is successful, the Death Star explodes and the player is awarded a bonus shield up to a maximum of 6. Should the player fail to hit the exhaust port, a shield is lost and the player must attempt the trench again. If the player manages to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything but the exhaust port, they are awarded a bonus for "using the Force."[CR]The game then resets to the first phase. Each successive Death Star run greatly increases the difficulty; TIE Fighters shoot more often, there are more Laser towers and batteries in the second round, and there are many more obstacles and laser fire during the trench run. Unlike the movie, where the units shoot beams similar to lasers, the enemy units in this game shoot projectiles resembling fireballs, in order to give the player a chance to destroy the fired shots.[2]</plot>

    <plot>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back recreates a scene from the movie of the same name. You are on the icy planet of Hoth, and Imperial Walkers are closing in on the rebel power generator. As the pilot of a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!</plot>

Cruising through the blackness of deep space, you call up the galactic chart on your monitor. Radar reveals enemy starfighters closing in on one of the starbases you are sworn to protect. Your onboard computers instantly calculate the energy required to intercept. Fire up your engines and warp into hyperspace. Stars and meteor showers streak by as you enter an enemy sector. Then, the battle begins. Your laser cannons blast away at attacking enemy starfighters. But wait! Damage reports show enemy fire has destroyed your defensive shields. Quickly but carefully, you maneuver back through the galaxy to dock at your starbase for repairs. And, undaunted, you return to complete your mission.</plot>

    <plot>Stargate is an arcade game released in 1981 by Williams Electronics. Created by Eugene Jarvis, it is a sequel to the 1980 game Defender, and was the first of only three productions from Vid Kidz, an independent development house formed by Jarvis and Larry DeMar. This video game has no connection to the subsequent Stargate franchise that began 13 years later.</plot>

    <plot>Space-security approaches the abandoned asteroid Stronghold, activating a volley of defense drones. Skillfully you must pilot your attack ship through the explosive space-waste; a single scrape will pierce the skin of your fragile ship. Without warning the bleak surface of the heavily-fortified Stronghold is energized by three moving force shields that protect a lethal asteroid crawler. The automatic systems of the seemingly derelict Stronghold are functioning perfectly, heat sensor interceptors launch to track and destroy your spacecraft. Survival depends on blasting through the whirling force shields and devastating the crawling command center as it fires repeatedly trying to eliminate your frail ship.</plot>

    <genre>Driving, Racing</genre>
    <plot>Stunt Cycle was one of Atari's first "Non-Pong" standalone consoles, and was based off the Atari coin-op of the same name.  The console consisted of a set of handlebar grips, which you could use to make your cycle move faster or slower and a fire button used to make you jump.  The gameplay revolves around making your "Stunt Cycle" jump over cars (ala Evil Knievel) and land safely on the other side without flying off the end of the screen.  Your cycle starts at the top of the screen, where you are given two "rows" of screen space to build up speed before hitting the ramp at the bottom.  The "trick" to the game is to build up enough speed to jump over the cars, but not too much that you go crashing off the edge of the screen.  If you successfully make the jump the row of cars gets wider and you have to go back and jump it again.[CR]Sometime in 1980 Atari decided that Stunt Cycle would make a great 2600 game, so Bob Polaro was tapped to do the conversion.  Using the paddle controllers to simulate the original consoles bike grips, Bob made a perfect port of the standalone console.  One change that was made to the game was the addition of color.  Since the original coin-op and home console were from 1976, the graphics were in Black and White (which was standard at the time).  Since Atari 2600 games had to have the option of color or B&amp;W, some color was added to the game (although not much) to spruce it up.  After a few months of programming, Stunt Cycle was finished and ready to go.[CR]It was around this time that marketing had "brilliant" idea; why not make Stunt Cycle into a Dukes of Hazzard game?  So Bob went back to work retooling the graphics to fit the new Dukes of Hazzard theme.  The cycle was changed into the General Lee, while the row of cars was changed into a lake.  Some Dukes of Hazzard theme music was also added to the game to complete the illusion. [CR]So after a few more months of tinkering, the new Dukes of Hazzard version of Stunt Cycle was good to go, but there was a problem.  Cleaver playtesters soon realized that you could change the speed on the car in mid-air!  This means you could go full blast at the ramp and then slow down suddenly after you've made the jump, but before you've landed.  This basically took the challenge out of the whole game, making it fairly boring.  After Dukes of Hazzard was shelved, programmer Mark Hahn was then tapped to do a totally new Dukes of Hazzard game from scratch (which was never released either). [CR]Did Atari make the right decision in canceling Stunt Cycle?  This is a hard question to answer since it's unknown what Atari's original motives were.  Had Stunt Cycle been released in 1980 as a color port of the coin-op it probably would have been very successful since people who bought it would have known what they were getting, and wouldn't mind the blocky graphics, which were standard for that time.  Had Atari released it as Dukes of Hazzard a year later, people would have probably felt gypped as it wouldn't be long before they realized that the game was nothing more than Stunt Cycle with new graphics.  Atari made the right decision in not releasing the updated Dukes of Hazzard version, but screwed up by not releasing the original Stunt Cycle version.  Chalk this one up to another act of Atari mismanagement.[CR]Strangely Stunt Cycle was never mentioned in any Atari catalogs, and was never assigned a product number.

    <plot>Players take on the role of a stuntman who has to escape various dangers and make it to a flying helicopter.[CR]Stuntman is broken down into three timed stages. The first stage has the stuntman climbing ropes in order to get to a helicopter while also dodging flying birds. The second stage has the stuntman climbing ropes again but now arms him with a sword and requires him to defeat the flying devilfaces before he can make his escape. The third stage has the stuntman climbing ropes again dodging enemies, but he must also grab a hold of all of the balloons on the stage before he make his getaway. The stages then repeat in this order two more times with the later stages increasing the challenge by adding more enemies. After completing the nine stages, the game repeats at the next highest speed level. There are six speed levels in total and the desired speed level may be chosen from the beginning also.</plot>

    <plot>Nighttime in the frigid North Atlantic. Home of the Great White Shark. The Giant Squid. And hundreds of deadly, killer subs. Enemy submarines, that have embarked on a suicide mission that will deal a death blow to our fleet. And only the Captain of one destroyer can stop them now. With an eye on the radar screen and a finger on the trigger, you frantically steam back and forth across the surface, laying down one depth charge pattern after another. The ping of the sonar fills the night. The sound of exploding depth charges fills the ocean, as you pick off one submarine after another, hoping you've picked the perfect moment to sink the glowing nuclear subs.</plot>

    <plot>Submarine Commander is one of those games that taxes your ability to "fill in the gaps" where 8 bit pixels fail to paint the whole picture. I could have said it was "graphically challenged" or "looks like Hell", but it's a better game than first glance might reveal. There are a slew of crappy looking one-dimensional games out there for the Atari 2600, but submarine Commander isn't one of them. Someone put a good deal of thought into it and gave it life beyond a simple single-screen game.</plot>

    <plot>Subterranea is a side scrolling shooter. Your goal is to locate treasure crystals within the Hexuplex Caves. Controlling your cave ranger, you need to blast the various types of aerobots which are guarding the cave. When all of the bots on a cave level have been destroyed, a passageway opens allowing you to travel deeper into the caverns. When you reach the last level of the cavern, you can collect the treasure crystal and be transported to the next (more challenging) set of caves and try for another crystal. In addition to the deadly aerobots, be sure not to crash into cave walls; these will drain your energy rapidly, especially if you hit one of the skulls. When all of your reserve cave rangers have crashed, the game is over. As you progress through the caves, they become narrower and the enemies move faster. Standard and advanced skill levels are available.</plot>

    <plot>Suicide Mission is an arcade action game similar to Asteroids. You control a microscopic submarine navigating the bloodstream of someone who has been infected by a virus. Your goal is to destroy the virus! Each time you shoot a cell infected with the virus, it will split up into smaller pieces. Eventually the pieces will be small enough that they can be destroyed. When everything has been destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult level. The game features three levels of difficulty, and you can choose one of two shooting styles for your submarine (single torpedoes, or rapid fire).</plot>

Also, the options were reduced to one or two player and whether, in one player, the human player is up first at bat or not.[CR]Otherwise, everything else is the same. You still can throw fastballs, curve balls, sinkers, etc. and you can still bunt, hit fly balls, etc. Scoring remains the same with a tie after nine innings going into extra innings. The difficulty switches do not have any use.</plot>

    <plot>In Super Breakout, there are three different and more advanced game types from which the player can choose:[CR]Double gives the player control of two bats at the same time—one placed above the other—and two balls. Losing a life occurs only when both balls go out of play, and points are doubled while the player is able to juggle both balls without losing either.[CR]Cavity retains the single bat and ball of Breakout, but two other balls are enclosed on the other side of the wall, which the player must free before they, too, can be used to destroy additional bricks. Points are increased for this, but triple points are available if the player can keep all three balls in play.[CR]Progressive also has the single bat and ball, but as the ball hits the paddle, the entire wall gradually advances downwards step by step, gaining in speed the longer the ball lasts in play.</plot>

    <plot>Super Cobra (スーパーコブラ Sūpā Kobura?) is a 1981 arcade game, the sequel to popular horizontally scrolling shooter Scramble, Super Cobra was developed by Konami and manufactured and distributed by Stern in North America. It is similar in concept to its predecessor, but much more difficult.[CR]The game was a success, selling 12,337 video game arcade cabinets in the United States in four months, by October 2, 1981, becoming Stern's third best-selling arcade classic after Berzerk and Scramble. Scramble sold 15,136 cabinets in the US in five months earlier that year, adding up to 27,473 US cabinet sales for both.[1][CR]Super Cobra was widely ported by Parker Brothers, and there was an Adventure Vision handheld version from Entex.[CR]The player controls a helicopter through tight caverns, and the slightest misstep will result in the loss of a life. However, unlike Scramble the game can be continued where the player left off by adding more credits.[CR]The joystick accelerates, decelerates, moves up, and moves down. The helicopter uses a laser and bomb to destroy defenders, tanks, and UFO's while infiltrating 10 Super Cobra defense systems.[2][CR]The ship has a limited fuel supply, which is depleted over time. More fuel can be acquired by destroying fuel tanks in the game.[2][CR]The game is divided into ten sections, plus a finale, each with a different style of terrain and different obstacles. Players navigate through ten levels and a base, where they must safely make it through the level and remove the booty. The levels are described as follows,[2][CR]Player must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.[CR]Chopper faces Arcing missiles over a mountain terrain.[CR]Smart Bombs flying in groups of four over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.[CR]Single Smart Bombs over mountainous terrain. Again, Rockets appear, but do not fire.[CR]Chopper flies through a cavern-like terrain against falling mines.[CR]Rapidly firing, roving tanks over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.[CR]Maneuver through a field of meteors which explode when hit with bombs or 3 times with laser, plus a single, green, shadow meteor directly in front of chopper which explodes when hit five times with laser. Rockets appear but do not fire.[CR]Chopper flies over mountainous terrain against rapidly firing UFOs. Tanks and rockets appear, but do not fire.[CR]Chopper faces arcing missiles over tall buildings.[CR]Firing rockets in a building maze.[CR]Base: Player must maneuver the chopper over tall buildings against arcing missiles and rapidly firing tanks to reach the Booty and safely carry it away.[CR]There is no intermission between each section; the game simply scrolls into the new terrain. If the player destroys the booty on the final level, they must start back at the beginning of the level.</plot>

    <plot>The Man of Steel takes flight in his first video game adaptation. When Lex Luthor destroys the Metropolis bridge, Clark Kent must run to the nearest phone booth to become Superman and save the day. Along the way, Superman must be wary of thugs, a helicopter that can either help or hinder him, three Kryptonite satellites, and even Lex Luthor himself. If Superman meets with one of Luthor's Kryptonite traps, he becomes unable to fly, unless he can find Lois Lane for help. Repair the bridge, put the crooks in jail, then get back to the Daily Planet in time for the next adventure.</plot>

    <plot>In Surfer's Paradise, the player's objective is to stay on top of a wave as long as possible. From time to time, a shark will approach the player who can in turn jump to try to avoid the shark. If they fail or if they don't manage to stay on top of the wave, they will drop into the water.The underwater sequence makes up the second part of the game. Here, the player has to get from the left side of the screen to the right side and back onto their surf board. However, there's a sunken galleon in their way. The player has to navigate a maze of walls in a limited amount of time while also avoiding oncoming jellyfish.Once the player reaches the top of the board, a new and more difficult round starts. Scoring is achieved by staying on top of the wave as long as possible. Extra lives are awarded for every 1000 points.</plot>

You move the target reticle by moving the joystick and fire weapons by pressing the red button. You can see the ships coming in the distance but if they get too close they will fire on you, causing you to lose energy. If you see a force field, you will see a square to the right. Shoot the square to disable the field. If your ship hits the field, you lose energy. You gain energy when you destroy a ship or disable a force field. Use the map on the top of your screen to determine which path to take, left or right. If you choose the wrong path or run out of energy, the game is over.</plot>

    <plot>Sweat! was to be Starpath's version of Activision's Decathlon for the Supercharger.  Given the fact that the Supercharger allowed for more memory and larger games, Sweat! probably would have been an amazing game had it been completed.  Of course this never happened as the video game market was crumbling rapidly and people weren't spending money on regular video games, much less games that required special hardware.  It was around this time that the financially troubled Starpath merged with Epyx.  Most of Starpath's programmers transferred over to Epyx and used Sweat!'s game concept to create Summer Games.</plot>

    <plot>This game was finished at MNetwork in the 1980's, but never released. In 2000, Intellivision Productions released this game complete with a simple box and manual. It is still available from their web site. Swordfight requires two players, which is possibly why the game was not released in the first place.</plot>

    <plot>Telepathy is one of two known prototype games that were developed for Atari's failed Mindlink controller.  The Mindlink was a headband that player wore on his head and plugged into the joystick port.  The idea was that the Mindlink's sensors would pick up any facial movements or muscle twitches the player would make.  Atari actually said that the Mindlink read the player's thoughts (sure it did...).  The problem was that the Mindlink didn't work very well in initial test runs, and even when it did work players would complain of headaches and dizziness from twitching their face all day.  After disappointing test results, the Mindlink controller was wisely canceled. [CR]Unlike most games of the time, Telepathy has a demo mode which will run through all the screens if the game is left untouched.  Interestingly you can control the player in the demo using the joystick, it's unknown if this was intentional or just a bug.  The game starts off with a really cool sign which descends from the top of the screen telling you which mine your on.  After that you're whisked off to the first screen.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/telepathy/telepathy.htm</plot>

    <plot>On the list of games that should never have been tried on the 2600, Tempest has to be near the top.  Why Atari decided they could reproduce a 3D vector game on the 2600 is beyond me, but the results were disastrous.  Thankfully Atari killed off this experiment gone wrong before it could hurt anybody.[CR]I've said it once and I'll say it again; If there's one thing the 2600 doesn't do it's diagonals.  Unfortunately Tempest is chockfull of diagonals as the tubes angle out from the center of the screen to form complex geometric patterns.  This leads us to the next problem, if there's a second thing the 2600 doesn't do it's complex geometric patterns!  The 2600 version gets around this by not having 3D tubes, but rather a flat looking shape with the enemies coming from one side and the player moving on the other.  For some reason the "shape" seems to flux and change a bit as things move around the screen, this is probably the result of a programming glitch.  The "shape" is segmented into what could be called tubes (if you use your imagination), but these "tubes" don't seem to correspond to where the real tubes (which are invisible) are. [CR]This brings us to the next problem, if there's a third thing the 2600 doesn't do it's 3D perspective.  Atari couldn't get around this one; the 3D perspective is what makes Tempest "Tempest".  Atari tried to simulate this by changing the enemy's size to make it look like it was getting closer.  Unfortunately there aren't nearly enough frames of animation to do this, so the enemies sort of jump forward in an awkward fashion.  The enemy graphics are very blocky and becomes even more evident as the size is increased when they approach the outer edge of the tube.  This combined with a very blocky looking "shape" for the board makes for one nasty looking game.[CR]In the programmers defense, they did a wonderful job on Tempest considering they were asked to do the impossible.  Since this version isn't complete, it's really not fair to start judging it yet.  Given some time, I'm sure a much more playable version with improved graphics and smother gameplay could have been put together.  While it probably wouldn't have ever looked like its arcade counterpart, this prototype proves that Tempest could (in a very limited fashion) be done on the 2600.  A later version with some added features like a title screen was reviewed in Ultimate Gamer magazine, but it's unknown what happened to that prototype.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/tempest/tempest.htm</plot>

    <plot>Thwocker was one of the long lost Activision prototypes that finally surfaced in 2001 when it was found a thrift shop along with some other prototypes.  Like most other unreleased Activision games, Thwocker was never mentioned in any catalogs or announced at any gaming expos.  Apparently Activision liked to keep their games secret until they were sure it was going to be released.  Not a bad policy.[CR]Thwocker is a game as strange as its name.  Written by Charlie Heath (of Reactor fame), Thwocker was described as "Joust with musical instruments".  While this isn't a bad description, it really doesn't illustrate all the gameplay elements that make Thwocker such an interesting game.  You control a little conductor (who happens to look like a bowling ball) who must bounce around a maze collecting musical notes for his song.  Along the way you must avoid various musical instruments that are out to get you (can't we all just get along?).  However you can't go grabbing just any musical notes, you must collect them in the proper order.  The current note type needed is shown at the bottom of the screen.  If you touch the wrong type of note you will ricochet off it, send your conductor flying across the screen (usually into a waiting enemy).  After collecting all the notes you must grab the treble clef symbol at the top of the maze to start the song.[CR]Once the song starts to play your character will be able to touch enemies and notes for points (think of it as a power pellet) until the song ends.  After completing the song you can exit the level by touching the exit square.[CR]The controls in Thwocker take a little getting use to, but they're not as tricky as they first seem.  The levels seem to be made out of some kind of springy material, so your character bounces all around the screen.  You can control how high you bounce by pushing up and down.  Pushing down will make the conductor take little bounces, while pressing up (as you touch the ground) will make him bounce really high.  You can stop bouncing all together by pressing the fire button, which will make the conductor sort of "skip" across the level.  You will need to master all these bouncing techniques to successfully complete the level.[CR]Sadly Thwocker is incomplete as there is no way to exit the level.  It was thought that they player simply needed to touch the exit square after completing the song to finish the level, but this does not appear to be the case.  It appears that the code that allows you to destroy the enemy after completing the song also allows you to destroy the exit, so the game appears to be unwinnable.  However after careful examination of the game code, it appears there may be more to Thwocker than meets the eye.  Apparently the player must somehow "combine" the two voices of the song after it starts playing to exit the level.  Unfortunately we haven't figured out how this portion of the game works yet, but it may have something to do with picking up certain objects on the screen.  However just because the code to exit the level exists doesn't mean it's actually possible to do it in the game, so Thwocker may still be unwinnable after all. [CR]Thankfully you can still see the other levels by selecting the higher difficulty levels at the title screen.  Programmer Charlie Heath (who owns the only other known prototype) has said that Thwocker is only around 80% complete when development was cancelled.  One has to wonder what else Charlie had in store for us, as other than the lack of the ability to finish a level Thwocker seems fully playable and complete.  Perhaps there were some minor game or difficulty issues left to work out?  The only glitch I've seen in the game is on the game select screen.  The game number should go from 1 to 10, but there are six games in between 9 and 10.  [CR]Thwocker, along with Kabobber, were victims of the collapsing videogame market in 1984.  It was around this time that Activision decided it was time to get out of the 2600 market and concentrate on the new gaming fad Home Computers.  Activision did release a few new games during the 2600 revival years, but Thwocker was not one of them.  At this point Activision was concentrating on converting arcade games to the 2600 instead of releasing older unpublished games.  What they didn't realize is that the older games they were ignoring were much better than the new games they were putting out (but that's another story).  Thankfully Thwocker finally got its long overdue release, and now we can all enjoy what has to be one of the most unique 2600 games I've ever seen.[CR]These game numbers are represented by a space, another space, a white eigth note, a space, a white quarter note, and a dot.  This is most likely because the game numbers are stored in hex (base 16), so there are 16 games represented.  It is unknown if Charlie actually intended for there to be 16 games or only 10, but since they all seem to be playable one comes to the conclusion that they were indeed planned.[CR]http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/thwocker/thwocker.htm</plot>

    <plot>Prepare for fierce aerial combat with aircraft that span the years since the dawn of aviation. Your timeship's first encounter is with ancient 1910 biplanes; you're outnumbered, but your weapons are superior. Eliminate the entire air fleet; then knock out a mighty zeppelin and you'll progress to the next stage: 1940 monoplanes. These World War II fighters present a tougher challenge, and if you can defeat them, you'll move on to 1970 helicopters. Down the choppers and warp ahead to meet 1983 super jets. If you find a way to beat them, you'll cross the final barrier and head into the future for a deep-space duel with deadly flying saucers from the year 2001!</plot>

    <plot>The screams of the crowd shake the arena as the Title Belt contenders circle one another. Mad Dog makes the first move smashing his fists into Skin Head's chest who gasps for air, then retaliates with a shin cracking kick. [CR]Mad Dog growls and grabbing from behind drags Skin Head across the ring whipping him around in an airplane spin; letting go so he flies into the ropes and bounces back to meet Mad  Dog's concrete forearm across his neck... a perfectly executed clothesline. [CR]Wasting no time Mad Dog elbow drops him. Skin Head's face winces in pain as he fights his way up and staggers to his corner to tag his partner in. [CR]Big Chief takes the tag, grabs Mad Dog lifting him over his head and body slams him into the mat. Mad Dog's stunned, he's not getting up. [CR]Big Chief, looking for the pin, climbs the ropes for a dive. As he lunges into the air, Mad Dog scrambles to his feet and Big Chief's sweaty red skinned body splatters on the empty mat.</plot>

    <plot>Tooth Protectors is one of the earliest "advergames" or "promogames" – games with overt tie-ins to retail products – and one of several released that year for the Atari 2600 platform (others included M Network's Kool-Aid Man and Purina's Chase the Chuck Wagon.) Commissioned by Johnson &amp; Johnson and developed by DSD/Camelot, it was the only game released for the Atari 2600 by either company.[CR]In Tooth Protectors, the player must prevent the snack squares from reaching the row of white teeth along the bottom of the screen; repeated hits by the snacks cause the teeth to blink and disappear from tooth decay.</plot>

    <plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]110m HurdlesTrack &amp; Field is an Olympic themed arcade game developed and published by Konami. It is known as Hyper Olympic in Japan.It has been ported to over nine different platforms including the NES, as well as Xbox Live Arcade, since its original release.Track &amp; Field introduced a button-mashing style of gameplay in which the player must press a button as fast as possible, and their in-game character interacts with the environment accordingly. This style of gameplay is still used today by many popular titles. The arcade release accommodated up to four players at once. The NES version (arguably the most popular) was designed for only two players. Track &amp; Field has received graphical and sound updates, leaderboards, online play, and additional events since its initial release in 1983. The Atari 2600 version included a specialized controller, mimicking the arcade input.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Long JumpIn the arcade version of Track &amp; Field, players had two "run" buttons and one "action" button. The run buttons were used to increase the speed of the character on-screen, while the action button was used to do things like initiate a jump or adjust the angle of a javelin throw. The NES version (possibly due to hardware limitations) had only one run button.100 Meter Dash110 Meter HurdlesHammer ThrowHigh JumpJavelin ThrowLong JumpIn each event, there is a qualifying time or level that the player must achieve to advance to the next event; failing to qualify (in one heat for running events or three tries in the other events) ends the game. Events that were later added to Track &amp; Field after the arcade release include: 100-meter freestyle, skeet shooting, vault, archery, triple jump, weight lifting, and pole vault.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade[CR]A slightly enhanced version of Track &amp; Field was released for XBLA in 2007. It includes full Xbox Live support (ranked and player matches) and in-depth leaderboards.[CR]The Track &amp; Field Legacy[CR]Archery was added after the original arcade release.Over the years, Konami released several games featuring gameplay from the same vein as the original:Konami '88 (1988) (Arcade)Track &amp; Field II (1988) (NES)Track &amp; Field (1992) (Game Boy)International Track &amp; Field (1996) (PS)Hyper Athlete (1996) (Arcade)Nagano Winter Olympics '98 (1998) (N64, PS)International Track &amp; Field 2000 (1999) (N64, PS, GBC)ESPN International Track &amp; Field (2000) (DC, PS2, GBC)Track and Field (2007) (Xbox Live Arcade)New International Track &amp; Field (2008) (NDS)[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The 1984 March of Dimes International Konami/Centuri Track &amp; Field Challenge was the largest video game tournament in history, with over a million contestants, including 800,000 in the US and 200,000 in Japan. The top 3 players from each country formed teams, with the finale taking place in Japan; the US team won the tournament. </plot>

    <plot>Tunnel Runner is a 3D Maze Game, essentially what a 1st person version of Pac-Man game would be like. Your primary goal is to locate and collect the hidden key, located in a different spot within each maze. Through the assistance of your map, you can maneuver within the maze. While attempting to locate the key to exit the level, you must also avoid enemies throughout the maze. Successfully recovering the key opens the portal to the next level. As you pass each level the complexity and difficulty increases, while your map gradually reveals less and less information.</plot>

The game was originally titled Tutankhamen, but it was discovered that the full name could not fit on the arcade cabinet, so the title was shortened.[citation needed][CR]Tutankham is one of six games chosen to appear in the LIFE magazine photo-session conducted at Twin Galaxies on November 7, 1982, featuring video game record holders of the 1982-era, gathered for a group photograph. The Tutankham champion in the photo is Mark Robichek of Mountain View, California.</plot>

    <plot>Venture is an action game in which you control Winky, the heroic adventurer. Your goal is to collect as many treasures as you can which are scattered throughout numerous dungeons. In each dungeon, there are several chambers which each contain a treasure. Armed only with your crossbow, you need to get past the varied creatures which guard the chamber, snag the treasure, and make it out again. When you collect the treasure from each of the chambers in a dungeon, you can then move on to the next, more difficult dungeon.</plot>

    <plot>The ancient game of strategy can now be played on your television screen with the release of Atari's Video Chess. The goal is still the same: capture your opponent's king while protecting your own. Video Chess is a one-player game that offers eight different skill levels, including a special children's level that is appropriate for those still learning how to play.[CR]Each player begins with sixteen pieces on opposite sides of a checkered game board: eight pawns, two bishops, two knights, two rooks, one queen and one king. One side plays with black, the other with white. Depending on the rank (with the pawn being the lowest and king highest), each piece can move across the board a certain number of spaces or in a specific direction.</plot>

    <plot>When you are ready to start exercising, step on the FOOT CRAZ ACTIVITY PAD GREEN dot. It starts the pace symbols moving around each track. [CR]There are two tracks displayed on the screen. To start moving the jogger figure, jog alternately on the ORANGE and SLUE dots on the FOOT CRAZ ACTIVITY PAD. The faster you jog, the faster the jogger figure moves around the track. Lap count, time and score are displayed on the bottom of the screen. Once around the track is equal to approximately thirty-five yards. [CR]To add variety and greater challenge to JOGGER, you may at any time, switch the jogger figure to the lower, faster track by stepping on the RED dot of the FOOT CRAZ ACTIVITY PAD, and back again to the upper, slower track by stepping on the YELLOW dot. [CR]JOGGER is more effective at the slower pace. The length of time jogging is more beneficial to your fitness than moving at sprint speed. [CR]Track laps are counted, giving JOGGER a competitive feature for increased family pleasure. After 2,000 points are accumulated, the pace syrnbol speed increases and challenges you to jog faster. [CR]Five minutes into your run, a second pace symbol appears on each track, making JOGGER even more spirited among participants. [CR]Bonus points may be earned by passing the pace symbol when it is GREEN. If you pass when it is RED, you lose a "life." JOGGER gives you three "lives" before the sequence needs to be repeated. There are four levels of difficulty. [CR]When you exercise on JOGGER, it is beneficial to remember that you are running in place. Maintain an erect posture and you will get more out of your workout. Make certain that you jog on the BLUE and ORANGE dots. [CR]JOGGER is an excellent trainer for those who want to begin a jogging program, or trim off pounds.</plot>

It is the first of its kind, and was developed by EXIJS Corporation, the revolutionary high-technology company based in California's world-famous "Silicon Valley." It affords you the opportunity to create a lifelong exercise program. Wherever you have a television set and an Atari 2600VCS, you have your own physical fitness center. Together, the entire family can enjoy the fun and fitness available through the patent-pending "FOOT CRAZ" and the lively "JOGGER" and "REFLEX" programs. [CR]There are five squares displayed on the screen, each with a different color. When you see a "bug" appear on one of the colored squares, you have a limited [CR]time (one to three seconds, depending on the level) to step on the corresponding colored dot of the FOOT CRAZ ACTIVITY PAD. To train your reflexes further, a "bug" can appear on more than one colored square at the same time. You get a point for each correct hit. The level of difficulty increases every twenty points. There are eight "lives" per program. A life is lost each time you step on the wrong color or delay too long in hitting the dot. You should not Step on a colored square when a BUTTERFLY appears, If do, it takes one of your "lives:' REFLEX is the ideal trainer for those participating in aerobics, jazzercise, tennis, soccer, football, track and field, and snow and water skiing.</plot>

    <plot>The mission - you are defending the wall from attacking aliens. Don't let them hit as they make the wall weaker. This sounds simplistic and is, but highly addictive as you score points for every alien destroyed. If a segment of the outer wall is destroyed (by the aliens kamikaze into it) if this happens enough times the outer wall flashes and you need to move in a level, post haste. If you don't, you drift off to space and all is lost. Don't fret though you have a chance to regain lost wall space by simply staying alive. If you stay alive long enough with no more incidents, you can regain that which has been lost...precious wall.</plot>

    <plot>In Warlords, you need to defend yourself from three human and/or computer players. Each of the four players are in one of the corners of the screen guarded by a castle. You control a small shield which can be moved around the edge of the castle. To survive you need to use the shield to block a ball which bounces around the screen. If the ball hits your castle, it will take out some of the bricks. If a hole forms in the castle wall and the ball makes it though and hits your warlord, then you are out of the game. The last player left alive wins the battle, and the first player to win five battles wins the game! Several game options are included which allow you to either catch or ricochet the ball when the shield touches it, and control the speed of the game.</plot>

    <plot>Taking aim at the tormentors swarming outside your space craft's main View Port, you must destroy the space bandits' ships before they get you. At the same time, you must avoid the Photon Bombs with which some of your attackers are equipped. [CR]With controller in hand, your job is to shoot the space pirates out of the sky. Your ship maneuvers horizontally near the bottom one-fourth of the screen, and you can hold the fire button to fire continuously, or you can shoot one energy rod at a time.[CR]The space pirates' ships can maneuver in any direction all around the screen (including under your ship), but you can only shoot vertically. The enemy ships appear one at a time or in groups of two or three. If you hit any of the three ships in a group, the entire wave is eliminated. For every ship you hit, you get one point. When you reach 16 points, the pirates begin dropping photon bombs. When you earn 99 points, your score starts over again at zero.</plot>

    <plot>Wing War is an action game where you control a dragon. Beginning in your underground cave, your goal is to capture a sparkling diamond. To do this, you will first need to unlock the secret passage by bringing a fire, water and air crystal back to your cave. Crystals can be found by exploring the various locations available, usually you will need to destroy one of the many enemies so they turn into a crystal. Fire and water crystals can not be in the cave alone at the same time, an air crystal must be placed between them; so you will need to bring back the crystals in the order fire, air, water or water, air, fire. Once you've done this a super crystal is formed unlocking the secret passage so you can try to get the diamond! Your dragon has a limited amount of energy; being hit by enemies will cause the energy to deplete, and the game ends when all of your dragons have lost all their energy.</plot>

It is armed with vertical and horizontal firing lasers and capable of incredible maneuverability.[CR]Opposing you is the Scroll -- a diabolic device designed to wear out the wrist an boggle the mind. The Scroll parades the alphabet across the screen, taunting you to duplicate a word or scrambled letters flashed at the bottom of the screen.[CR]You must shoot each letter in perfect order, and you must match three words or letter combinations within 99 seconds.[CR]Sounds easy?

    <plot>X-Man is a pornographic video game made for the Atari 2600 by Universal Gamex, programmed by Alan Roberts and H. K. Poon. This game was released in 1983.[CR]This game has nothing to do with the similarly named Marvel's comic book series entitled X-Men. It is the only title made by Universal Gamex. It had faced protest from women’s groups when it was first released, and most retailers declined to carry it - or if they did, buyers had to be 18 years old to purchase the game, or it was kept under-the-counter. It could also be purchased via mail order, and an ad inviting such purchases appeared in at least one gaming magazine a full-page ad can be found in the July 1983 issue of Videogaming Illustrated. Consequently, as of 2014, it is very hard to find. However, it is easier to find this game in PAL format and rarer in NTSC.[CR]There have been reports that there are between twenty and forty-five cartridges in existence.</plot>

    <plot>Xenos. The very name strikes fear into every colonist's heart. A distress call is received from space stations orbiting your homeworld, then silence. A single ship escapes, piloted by a battered man who tells the tale of pods that hatch into acid-spitting Xenos. A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld. [CR]Xenophobe is a side-scrolling shooter with platform elements. Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it. You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additional weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.</plot>

    <plot>n Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar, which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.</plot>
